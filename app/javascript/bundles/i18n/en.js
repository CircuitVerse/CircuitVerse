        "Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!",
        "All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.",
        "Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?",
        "And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.",
        "Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.",
        "Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?",
        "Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...",
        "Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.",
        "Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?",
        "Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!",
        "Crazy drunk driver.",
        "Damn! I'm late for school!",
        "Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.",
        "Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.",
        "Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.",
        "Give me a Pepsi Free.",
        "Great Scott!",
        "He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!",
        "He's a Peeping Tom!",
        "He's an absolute dream!",
        "He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.",
        "Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?",
        "Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.",
        "Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!",
        "Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!",
        "Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?",
        "Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.",
        "Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!",
        "I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!",
        "I finally invent something that works!",
        "I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.",
        "I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.",
        "I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?",
        "I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!",
        "I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.",
        "I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.",
        "I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.",
        "I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!",
        "I've never seen purple underwear before!",
        "If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.",
        "If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.",
        "It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!",
        "It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.",
        "Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.",
        "Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.",
        "Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.",
        "Let's see if you bastards can do 90.",
        "Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.",
        "Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.",
        "Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.",
        "Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.",
        "Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.",
        "Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.",
        "Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.",
        "Marty, will we ever see you again?",
        "Maybe you were adopted.",
        "My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.",
        "Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!",
        "No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.",
        "No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!",
        "No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!",
        "No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.",
        "No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.",
        "Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.",
        "Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.",
        "Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.",
        "Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!",
        "Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.",
        "Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.",
        "Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.",
        "Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.",
        "Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!",
        "Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.",
        "Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.",
        "Save the clock tower!",
        "Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.",
        "See you in about 30 years.",
        "See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.",
        "Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!",
        "Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?",
        "Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?",
        "So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.",
        "Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?",
        "Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!",
        "Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!",
        "That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?",
        "The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.",
        "The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?",
        "There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?",
        "Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.",
        "This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?",
        "Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?",
        "We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.",
        "Weight has nothing to do with it.",
        "Well, I figured, what the hell?",
        "Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.",
        "What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?",
        "What are you looking at, butthead?",
        "What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?",
        "What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!",
        "What-what the hell is a gigawatt?",
        "Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?",
        "Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?",
        "Whoa. This is heavy.",
        "Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?",
        "Yeah, well, history is gonna change.",
        "Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.",
        "You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.",
        "You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.",
        "You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?",
        "You really think I ought to swear?",
        "You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.",
        "You're late! Do you have no concept of time?"

        "I'm the thing that monsters have nightmares about.",
        "Strong is fighting. It's hard and it's painful, and it's every day. It's what we have to do. And we can do it together.",
        "I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth of hell, and it's gonna swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me. We're not ready? They're not ready.",
        "There is only one thing on this earth more powerful than evil. And that's us.",
        "So what — are we helpless puppets? No. The big moments are gonna come. You can't help that. It's what you do afterwards that counts. That's when you find out who you are.",
        "When it's really something that matters, they fight. I mean, they're lame morons for fighting, but they do. They never— they never quit. And so I guess I will keep fighting, too.",
        "If the apocalypse comes, beep me.",
        "The hardest thing in this world is to live in it.",
        "In every generation there is a chosen one. She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the slayer.",
        "I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.",
        "Cordelia, your mouth is open, sound is coming from it. This is never good.",
        "Harmony, when you tried to be head cheerleader, you were bad. When you tried to chair the Homecoming committee, you were really bad. But when you try to be bad... you suck.",
        "They were supposed to be my light at the end of the tunnel. I guess they were a train.",
        "I don't know what's coming next. But I do know it's gonna be just like this.",
        "Well, I like you. You're nice, and you're funny, and you don't smoke. Yeah, okay, werewolf, but... that's not all the time. I mean, three days out of the month, I'm not much fun to be around either.",
        "A good Sunnydale rule-of-thumb? Avoid white-skinned men in capes.",
        "I can kill a couple of geeks all by myself. But, hey, if you'd like to watch... I mean, that's what you Watchers are good at, right? Watching?",
        "I'm talking! Don't interrupt me! Insignificant man. I am Willow. I am death. If you dare defy me, I will call down my fury, exact fresh vengeance, and make your worst fears come true. Okay?",
        "Just because you're better than us doesn't mean you can be all superior.",
        "You should never hurt the feelings of a brutal killer. You know, that's, uh, that's actually some pretty good advice.",
        "A vampire isn't a person at all. It may have the movements, the memories, even the personality of the person it took over, but it's a demon at the core. There is no halfway.",
        "I'm leaning towards blind panic myself.",
        "Well, I'm a hair's breath from investigating bunnies at the moment, so I'm open to anything.",
        "Buffy, what you said, it flies in the face of everything we've ever... every generation has ever done in the fight against evil. I think it's bloody brilliant.",
        "Now, I know you haven't been in the game for a while, mate, but we still do kill people. Sort of our raison d'etre, you know.",
        "She wouldn't even kill me. She just left. She didn't even care enough to cut off my head, or set me on fire. I mean, is that too much to ask? You know? Some little sign that she cared? It was the truce with Buffy that did it. Dru said I'd gone soft - wasn't demon enough for the likes of her.",
        "Well, isn't this usually the part where you... kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?",
        "Oh, I don't know. Looking in the mirror every day and seeing nothing there...it's an overrated pleasure.",
        "Sorry about the chains. It's not that I don't trust you, it's... Actually, it is that I don't trust you.",
        "I'm just so excited. They come in, I help them, they give us money in exchange for goods, you give me money for working for you. I have a place in the world now. I'm part of the system. I'm a workin' gal.",
        "Wow, it's like, one second you were this klutzy teenager with false memories and a history of kleptomania, and then suddenly you were a hero. A hero with a much abbreviated life span.",
        "You gotta give me something to do. There's no way I'm sleeping. Don't you need anyone dead? Or maimed? I can settle for maimed.",
        "You know, I honestly don't think there's a human word fabulous enough for me.",
        "We don't know much about them except for they're very ugly, and they're very mobile for blind people.",
        "And I wonder what possible catastrophe came crashing down from heaven and brought this dashing stranger to tears?"

        "Generally you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.",
        "Hello, Ghostbusters... Yes, of course they're serious... You do?... You have?... No kidding! Just gimme the address... Oh sure, they will be totally discreet. Thank you!",
        "I feel like the floor of a taxi cab.",
        "As they say in T.V., I'm sure there's one big question on everybody's mind, and I imagine you are the man to answer that. How is Elvis, and have you seen him lately?",
        "Hee hee hee! 'Get her!'' That was your whole plan, huh, 'get her.' Very scientific.",
        "OK... so... she's a dog...",
        "Ray, pretend for a moment that I don't know anything about metallurgy, engineering, or physics, and just tell me what the hell is going on.",
        "I'm gonna take back some of the things I said about you, Egon.",
        "Tell him about the Twinkie.",
        "Sir, what you had there is what we refer to as a focused, non-terminal, repeating phantasm or a class-five full-roaming vapor. A real nasty one, too.",
        "Coming through! One class-five full-roaming vapor. Move 'em out.",
        "Hey, wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold it! Now, are we actually gonna go before a federal judge, and tell him that some moldy Babylonian god is going to drop in on Central Park West, and start tearing up the city?",
        "You know, you don't act like a scientist.",
        "You're more like a game show host.",
        "Well, this is great. If the ionization-rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities, we can really bust some heads... in a spiritual sense, of course.",
        "I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people.",
        "Some moron brought a cougar to a party and it went berserk.",
        "And then she threw me out of her life. She thought I was a creep, she thought I was a geek, and she probably wasn't the first.",
        "I think this building should be condemned. There's serious metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members, the wiring is substandard, it's completely inadequate for our power needs, and the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone.",
        "Wow. This place is great. When can we move in? You gotta try this pole. I'm gonna get my stuff. Hey. We should stay here. Tonight. Sleep here. You know, to try it out.",
        "Venkman, shorten your stream! I don't want my face burned off!",

        "Let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area. According to this morning's sample, it would be a twinkie... 35 feet long and weighing approximately 600 pounds.",
        "That's a big Twinkie.",
        "We could on the verge of a fourfold cross-reap. A P.K.E. surge of incredible, even dangerous proportions!",
        "Of course you forget, Peter. I was present at an undersea, unexplained mass sponge migration.",
        "Uhhh... this magnificent feast here represents the LAST of the petty cash.",
        "Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable. You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman!",
        "I think we can get her a guest shot on 'Wild Kingdom.' I just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of Thorazaine... she's gonna take a little nap now.",
        "Everybody can relax, I found the car. Needs some suspension work and shocks. Brakes, brake pads, lining, steering box, transmission, rear-end.",
        "Maybe now you'll never slime a guy with a positron collider, huh?",
        "So, what are we doing today, Zuul?",
        "We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.",

        "We have the tools, and we have the talent!",
        "Okay, Ghostbusters. The mayor wants to see you guys. The whole island's going crazy. Let's go.",
        "The structure of this roof cap is exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker that NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in deep space.",
        "Nobody ever made them like this! The architect was either a certified genius, or an authentic wacko.",
        "Nice thinking, Ray.",
        "It's true, your honor. The man is some kind of rodent, I don't know which.",
        "Is it just a mist, or does it have arms and legs?",
        "Nice doggy. Cute little pooch. Maybe I've got a Milk-Bone."

        "I love heroes, but I don't want to be one. Do you even know what a hero is!? For example, you have some meat. Pirates will feast on the meat, but the hero will distribute it among the people! I want to eat the meat!",
        "Don't ever think there's any perfect society made by humans!! If you think that way you'll overlook the enemy!! Don't be fooled by appearances!",
        "If I can't even protect my captain's dream, then whatever ambition I have is nothing but talk! Luffy must be the man who becomes the Pirate King!",
        "Old man, everyone!! And you.. Luffy. Even though I've been good for nothing my whole life, even though I have the blood of a demon within me... You guys still loved me! Thank you so much!!",
        "Compared to the \"righteous\" greed of the rulers, the criminals of the world seem much more honorable. When scum rules the world, only more scum is born.",
        "Pirates are evil? The Marines are righteous?... Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins this war becomes justice!",
        "When do you think people die? When they are shot through the heart by the bullet of a pistol? No. When they are ravaged by an incurable disease? No... It’s when they're forgotten!",
        "You can spill drinks on me, even spit on me. I'll just laugh about it. But If you dare to hurt my friends... I won't forgive you!",
        "The government says your existence is a crime, but no matter what kind of weapons you may hold, just being alive isn't a sin! There's no crime in living!",
        "ONE PIECE IS REAL!",
        "It's not some sort of special power. He has the ability to make allies of everyone he meets. And that is the most fearsome ability on the high seas.",
        "I want to live!",
        "Maybe nothing in this world happens by accident. As everything happens for a reason, our destiny slowly takes form.",
        "Food is a gift from god. Spices are a gift from the devil. It looks like it was a bit too spicy for you.",
        "I don't care now. I wanted to look like a human because I wanted friends. Now I want to be a monster who's helpful to Luffy!",
        "Miracles only happen to those who never give up.",
        "Stop counting only those things you have lost! What is gone, is gone! So ask yourself this. What is there... that still remains to you?!",
        "If you want to protect something, do it right! Don't let them get their way anymore!",
        "The royalty and nobles are behind the fire... Believe me... This town smells worse than Gray Terminal. It smells like rotten people! If I stay here... I'll never be free! I'm... ashamed to be born a noble!",
        "There comes a time when a man has to stand and fight! That time is when his friends' dreams are being laughed at! And I won't let you laugh at that!",
        "To true friendship, how long you've known each other means nothing.",
        "When the world shoves you around, you just gotta stand up and shove back. It's not like somebody's gonna save you if you start babbling excuses.",
        "People's dreams... Never end!",
        "If you kill yourself, I'll kill you!",

        "I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python.",
        "Because of the Turing completeness theory, everything one Turing-complete language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing-complete language, but at a different cost. You can do everything in assembler, but no one wants to program in assembler anymore.",
        "Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing. I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall, who is my hero actually. I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the freedom to choose.",
        "You want to enjoy life, don't you? If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun, that's good isn't it? That's the purpose of life, partly. Your life is better.",
        "People are different. People choose different criteria. But if there is a better way among many alternatives, I want to encourage that way by making it comfortable. So that's what I've tried to do.",
        "In our daily lives as programmers, we process text strings a lot. So I tried to work hard on text processing, namely the string class and regular expressions. Regular expressions are built into the language and are very tuned up for use.",
        "Most of the tasks we do are for humans. For example, a tax calculation is counting numbers so the government can pull money out from my wallet, but government consists of humans.",
        "Actually, I didn't make the claim that Ruby follows the principle of least surprise. Someone felt the design of Ruby follows that philosophy, so they started saying that. I didn't bring that up, actually.",
        "Smart people underestimate the ordinarity of ordinary people.",
        "Language designers want to design the perfect language. They want to be able to say, 'My language is perfect. It can do everything.' But it's just plain impossible to design a perfect language, because there are two ways to look at a language. One way is by looking at what can be done with that language. The other is by looking at how we feel using that language-how we feel while programming.",
        "I believe that the purpose of life is, at least in part, to be happy. Based on this belief, Ruby is designed to make programming not only easy but also fun. It allows you to concentrate on the creative side of programming, with less stress.",
        "Most programs are not write-once. They are reworked and rewritten again and again in their lived. Bugs must be debugged. Changing requirements and the need for increased functionality mean the program itself may be modified on an ongoing basis. During this process, human beings must be able to read and understand the original code. It is therefore more important by far for humans to be able to understand the program than it is for the computer.",
        "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.",
        "Man is driven to create; I know I really love to create things. And while I'm not good at painting, drawing, or music, I can write software.",
        "It is not the responsibility of the language to force good looking code, but the language should make good looking code possible.",
        "Plant a memory, plant a tree, do it today for tomorrow.",
        "Imagine you are writing an email. You are in front of the computer. You are operating the computer, clicking a mouse and typing on a keyboard, but the message will be sent to a human over the internet. So you are working before the computer, but with a human behind the computer.",
        "Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines.",
        "Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, 'I was surprised by this feature of the language, so therefore Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.' Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only.",
        "Sometimes people jot down pseudo-code on paper. If that pseudo-code runs directly on their computers, its best, isn't it? Ruby tries to be like that, like pseudo-code that runs. Python people say that too."

I wasnt surprised because the food at the FiDi location is the best so I figured this location would be just as good and it was!!! The enchiladas with the green sauce is to die for. My go to at the FiDi location is usually the chicken enchiladas but I decided to try something new and the shrimp enchiladas did not disappoint.",
        "For dessert, we ordered the chocolate drizzled churros and they were delicious too! They even came with some fresh fruit (blueberries and strawberries).",
        "Overall, the evening was a smash and I am so glad there is a new location closer to my office!!",
        "Brand new. Great design. Odd to hear pop music in a Mexican establishment. Music is a bit loud. It should be background.",
        "The chicken nachos were delicious and the atmosphere was great. The frozen margaritas were a little on the weak side. Would probably return for a work happy hour but was pretty disappointed about the lack of free tequila and beer we read about!",
        "The counter is on the left side, and so is the menu. It can get pretty busy with 30 min wait times. I recommend checking the website and see how busy their store is.",
        "They are way understaffed, where the cashier needs to stop taking orders to help pack to-go orders. The line ends up piling up and people are neglected.  Seen this happen multiple times during lunch hours.",
        "This particular location like the many other restaurants down the block has ample seating and a second floor.",
        "I first heard about this place through Instagram post. The drinks looked creative so I made it a point to give it try while in the city. Located inside American Eagle in Times Square they serve up the coolest non-alcoholic beverages. You have an array of options from tea, soda, coffee, latte, water and more. Theres countertops (with phone chargers) so youre able to stand and enjoy your beverage. This visit I opted for the Pegasus latte which was not only beautiful but tasted just as good as it looked. Great staff and great service. This is a must try if you are in the area. Im sure Ill be back soon!",
        "Great place to stop in from a chaotic Times Square adventure! The coffee is great, the drinks are creative and the staff is very nice and hospitable. Cant wait to stop in again. Without a doubt 5 stars from me!!",
        "Great lattes and cold drinks as well. Nice to see a place carrying local coffee and products in Times Square! Excited to make it a part of my morning commute as it is much less crowded than the chain coffee shops around here.",
        "Fish was high quality but portions were small. $57 for 9 pieces and a hand roll which is fair but on the expensive side.",
        "Ambience was good, service was no nonsense but friendly.",
        "Id have to say that each piece was fresh and had their own slight unique flavor twist to it, pushing the line between traditional edomae and fusion. The Hokkaido uni and the ocean trout topped with cook seaweed was the highlights of the meal. But each piece served was really something special.",
        "Staff was very accommodating but the chef were no nonsense. The ambiance is clean and tranquil which is perfect if youre looking to have a conversation with a date or a friend.",
        "My only critique would be that the rice could of used more vingaer and for them to use real wasabi. Also the variety of fish in stock wasnt a lot but hopefully that can change over time. The cost justify the quality youre getting. A solid 4 stars.",
        "In terms of omakase, they had a few options but the one we chose was the 87 dollar version which include sashimi and sushi."

He used to tell me stories when I was a little boy about these... endless blue skies, free air everywhere, open water all the way to the horizon. He told me that someday we would make Mars just like that. When you spend your whole life living under a dome, even the idea of an ocean seems impossible to imagine. I could never understand your people. Why, when the universe has bestowed so much upon you, you seem to care so little for it?",

        "This isn't just about the war, we need to contain the protomolecule, make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands!",

        "Fire. Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire that has broken out on the premises of 123 Cavendon Road... no, that's too formal. Fire - exclamation mark - fire - exclamation mark - help me - exclamation mark. 123 Cavendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours truly, Maurice Moss.",
        "I don't like goat's anything. I don't like goats being involved in any stage of the food production process.",
        "This flipping circuit board, Jen. Some chump has run the data lines right through the power supply. Amateur hour! I've got tears in my eyes!",
        "They're fairly regular the beatings, yes. I'd say we're on a Bi-weekly beating",
        "OK, lady! You've won this round! But we can wait. You will slip up one day. And believe you me, we will be there when you do. There will be some piece of evidence that will prove without any shadow of a doubt that you don't know anything about computers!",
        "Team! Team, team, team, team, team! I even love saying the word 'team'. You probably think that's a picture of my family. Uh uh. It's the A-Team! Bodie, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man.",
        "Why are you giving me the secret signal to shut up?",
        "Oh, it's just water. Sometimes I get a hot ear, and this helps cool it down. She is quite the oddball.",
        "I hope this doesn't embarrass you, Jen, but I find the best thing to do with a new employee is to size them up with a long, hard stare...",
        "That's the sort of place this is, Jen. A lot of sexy people, not doing much work and having affairs!",
        "Well, don't take this the wrong way, but could he have thought you were a man?",
        "Ah! The IT-department. Run by a dynamic go-getter, a genius and a man from Ireland.",
        "You wouldn't shoot a Policeman and then steal his helmet. You wouldn't go to the toilet in his helmet, and then send it to the Policeman's grieving widow, and then steal it again. Downloading films is stealing; if you do it you WILL face the consequences!",
        "Ah, well, prepare to put mustard on those words, for you will soon be consuming them along with this slice of humble pie that comes direct from the oven of shame set at gas mark 'egg on your face'! I sort of forget what I was talking about.",
        "Oh... morning. Oh my word. When did the English start drinking like that? You people drink like you don't want to live.",
        "You best put seat belts on your ears, Roy, 'cause I'm going to take them for the ride of their life!",
        "Listen, Alistair, I just wanted to say, I'm not a window cleaner. No, no, I work in IT. Yeah, yeah, with computers and all that. Macs? No, I just really work with Windows. Hello?",
        "I'm a 32 year old IT consultant who works in the basement. Yes, I do the whole lonely hearts thing.",
        "I only know one woman and she just left the room shouting 'The shoes!'",
        "Nice screensaver. I love the way the smoke seems to be coming off the top of it...",
        "A plan. Let me put on my slightly larger glasses.",
        "Hello? What? Well if you can't work as a team you're all fired. That's it, you heard me, fired! Get your things and go. Hello, security? Everyone on floor 4 is fired. Escort them from the premises. And do it as a team. Remember, you're a team and if you can't act as a team, you're fired too. Dom, get on to recruitment. Get them to look for a security team that can work as a team. They may have to escort the current security team from the building for not acting like a team.",
        "Never been. But I've always liked the idea of the theatre. The smell of the grease, the roar of the paint. I've often thought if I hadn't ended up in computers, I would've gone into the theatre.",
        "If this evening is going to work in any way, you need to pretend to be normal people, yeah? Keep the conversation about things that would interest everybody. You know, nothing about memory, or RAM.",
        "Roy, I spoke to the Elders of the Internet not one hour ago. I told them about Jen winning Employee of the Month and they were so impressed that they wanted to do whatever they could to help.",
        "Well, I'm the boss... Head Honcho. El Numero Uno. Mr. Big. The Godfather. Lord of the Rings. The Bourne... Identity. Er... Taxi Driver. Jaws. I forgot the question quite a while back. Who are you, again?",
        "Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them! Actually, that doesn't work as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages.",
        "Did you notice how she didn't even get excited when she saw this original ZX81?",
        "Shut up, do what I tell you, I'm not interested; these are just some of the things you'll be hearing if you answer this ad. I'm an idiot and I don't care about anyone but myself. P.S. No dogs!",
        "Oh, I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality.",
        "I'm sorry for your loss. Move on.",
        "It's not like you've lost a pen, is it? It's so much worse. Would you like a pen? I have a spare one.",
        "With all due respect John, I am the head of IT and I have it on good authority that if you type 'Google' into Google, you can break the Internet. So please, no one try it, even for a joke. It's not a laughing matter. You can break the Internet.",
        "Even if that were true, it's just not in their nature to learn how to use a ladder! They have wings! When a moth thinks about travelling vertically upwards, a ladder is just the last thing they would think of! Moss, I don't like to be negative about it, but everything you invent is worthless!",
        "You want me to open it. That's why you called me all the way up here, to open your laptop?",
        "Well, if someone called me a 'big, ugly builder', I'd be furious - and not just because I'm actually an IT consultant. Revenge, that would be uppermost on my mind: 'I'm going to wee on everything. I'm going to taint her abode. I'm going to strain my personal potatoes throughout her premises.'",
        "Just promise me we won't do anything else with them. I want to go back to being weird. I like being weird. Weird is all I've got. That and my sweet style.",
        "Balloons explode, Jen. They explode suddenly, and unexpectedly. They are filled with the capacity to give me a little fright, and I find that unbearable.",
        "I came here to drink milk and kick ass. And I've just finished my milk."

I was so nervous that when the cashier asked me for my money, I dropped it. My friend picked it up and handed it to me. She looked at me right in the eyes... didn't recognize me. I guess whatever you did to me worked better than I imagined.",

        "I'm afraid that won't work either. Now, you have to understand, Evey. I don't want this for either of us, but I couldn't see any other way. You were unconscious, and I had to make a decision. If I had left you there, right now, you'd be in one of Creedy's interrogation cells. They'd imprison you, torture you, and, in all probability, kill you in the pursuit of finding me. After what you did, I couldn't let that happen, so I picked you up and carried you to the only place I knew you'd be safe: here, to my home.",

And who will that be? You, Mr. Creedy. A man as smart as you has probably considered this. A man as smart as you probably has a plan. That plan is the reason Sutler no longer trusts you. It's the reason why you're being watched right now, why there are eyes and ears in every room of this house and a tap on every phone.",
        "Sutler. Come now, Mr. Creedy, you knew this was coming. You knew that one day, it'd be you or him. That's why Sutler's been kept underground, for 'security purposes'. That's why there are several of your men close to Sutler. Men that could be counted on. All you have to do is say the word.",
        "Tell me... do you like music, Mr. Finch?",
        "Thank you... but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds.",
        "That's it! See, at first I thought it was hate, too. Hate was all I knew, it built my world, it imprisoned me, taught me how to eat, how to drink, how to breathe. I thought I'd die with all my hate in my veins. But then something happened. It happened to me... just as it happened to you.",

        "This so called V and his accomplice Evey Hammond, neo-demagogues spouting their message of hate, a delusional and aberrant voice delivering a terrorist's ultimatum... An ultimatum that was met with swift, surgically precise justice! The moral of this story ladies and gentleman is... Good guys win, bad guys lose, and as always, England prevails!",
        "Tonight's your big night. Are you ready for it?... Are we ready for it?",

All you have to do is cooperate.",

        "Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.",
        "I know there's no way I can convince you this is not one of their tricks, but I don't care, I am me. My name is Valerie, I don't think I'll live much longer and I wanted to tell someone about my life. This is the only autobiography I'll ever write, and god, I'm writing it on toilet paper. I was born in Nottingham in 1985, I don't remember much of those early years, but I do remember the rain. My grandmother owned a farm in Tuttlebrook, and she use to tell me that god was in the rain. I passed my 11th lesson into girl's grammar; it was at school that I met my first girlfriend, her name was Sara. It was her wrists. They were beautiful. I thought we would love each other forever. I remember our teacher telling us that is was an adolescent phase people outgrew. Sara did, I didn't. In 2002, I fell in love with a girl named Christina. That year I came out to my parents. I couldn't have done it without Chris holding my hand. My father wouldn't look at me, he told me to go and never come back. My mother said nothing. But I had only told them the truth, was that so selfish? Our integrity sells for so little, but it is all we really have. It is the very last inch of us, but within that inch, we are free. I'd always known what I wanted to do with my life, and in 2015 I starred in my first film, 'The Salt Flats'. It was the most important role of my life, not because of my career, but because that was how I met Ruth. The first time we kissed, I knew I never wanted to kiss any other lips but hers again. We moved to a small flat in London together. She grew Scarlet Carsons for me in our window box, and our place always smelled of roses. Those were there best years of my life. But America's war grew worse, and worse. And eventually came to London. After that there were no roses anymore. Not for anyone. I remember how the meaning of words began to change. How unfamiliar words like 'collateral' and 'rendition' became frightening. While things like Norse Fire and The Articles of Allegiance became powerful, I remember how different became dangerous. I still don't understand it, why they hate us so much. They took Ruth while she was out buying food. I've never cried so hard in my life. It wasn't long till they came for me. It seems strange that my life should end in such a terrible place, but for three years, I had roses, and apologized to no one. I shall die here. Every inch of me shall perish. Every inch, but one. An Inch, it is small and it is fragile, but it is the only thing the world worth having. We must never lose it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us. I hope that whoever you are, you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better. But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you. I love you. With all my heart, I love you. -Valerie",
        "Listen to me, Evey. This may be the most important moment of your life. Commit to it. They took your parents from you. They took your brother from you. They put you in a cell and took everything they could take except your life. And you believed that was all there was, didn't you? The only thing you had left was your life, but it wasn't, was it? You found something else. In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life. It was when they threatened to kill you unless you gave them what they wanted... you told them you'd rather die. You faced your death, Evey. You were calm. You were still. Try to feel now what you felt then.",
        "My fellow Englishmen: tonight our country, that which we stand for, and all we hold dear, faces a grave and terrible threat. This violent and unparalleled assault on our security will not go undefended... or unpunished. Our enemy is an insidious one, seeking to divide us and destroy the very foundation of our great nation. Tonight, we must remain steadfast. We must remain determined. But most of all, we must remain united. Those caught tonight in violation of curfew will be considered in league with our enemy and prosecuted as a terrorist without leniency or exception. Tonight, I give you my most solemn vow: that justice will be swift, it will be righteous, and it will be without mercy.",
        "Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young up-and-coming politician. He's a deeply religious man and a member of the conservative party. He is completely single-minded convictions and has no regard for the political process. Eventually, his party launches a special project in the name of 'national security'. At first, it is believed to be a search for biological weapons and it is pursued regardless of its cost. However, the true goal of the project is power, complete and total hegemonic domination. The project, however, ends violently... but the efforts of those involved are not in vain, for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of their victims. Imagine a virus - the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon? It is at this point in our story that along comes a spider. He is a man seemingly without a conscience; for whom the ends always justify the means and it is he who suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself. Three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack: a school, a tube station, and a water-treatment plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks. Until at last the true goal comes into view. Before the St. Mary's crisis, no one would have predicted the outcome of the elections. No one. But after the election, lo and behold, a miracle. Some believed that it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members made them all obscenely rich. But the true genius of the plan was the fear. A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty, and executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims. Fear became the ultimate tool of this government. And through it our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of High Chancellor. The rest, as they say, is history.",
        "Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot... But what of the man? I know his name was Guy Fawkes and I know, in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. But who was he really? What was he like? We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I've witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I've seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them... but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it... ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love... And it is not an idea that I miss, it is a man... A man that made me remember the Fifth of November. A man that I will never forget.",
        "So I read that the former United States is so desperate for medical supplies that they have allegedly sent several containers filled with wheat and tobacco. A gesture, they said, of good will. You wanna know what I think? Well, you're listening to my show, so I will assume you do... I think it's high time we let the colonies know what we really think of them. I think its payback time for a little tea party they threw for us a few hundred years ago. I say we go down to those docks tonight and dump that crap where everything from the Ulcered Sphincter of Arse-erica belongs! Who's with me? Who's bloody with me? Did you like that? USA... Ulcered Sphincter of Arse-erica, I mean what else can you say? Here was a country that had everything, absolutely everything. And now, 20 years later, is what? The world's biggest leper colony. Why? Godlessness. Let me say that again... Godlessness. It wasn't the war they started. It wasn't the plague they created. It was Judgement. No one escapes their past. No one escapes Judgement. You think he's not up there? You think he's not watching over this country? How else can you explain it? He tested us, but we came through. We did what we had to do. Islington. Enfield. I was there, I saw it all. Immigrants, Muslims, homosexuals, terrorists. Disease-ridden degenerates. They had to go. Strength through unity. Unity through faith. I'm a God-fearing Englishman and I'm goddamn proud of it!",
        "Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."

Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes.

        "Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away - to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless.",

If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.",

Against this threat, upon the Jedi Knights falls the duty to lead the newly formed army of the Republic. And as the heat of war grows, so, to, grows the prowess of one most gifted student of the Force.",

        "Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!",
        "All right. This is an oldie, but, uh... well, it's an oldie where I come from.",
        "Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?",
        "And one for you, McFly; I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man. This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.",
        "Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.",
        "Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?",
        "Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something. I've had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him...",
        "Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.",
        "Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin?",
        "Course! From a group of Lybian Nationalists They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn I gave them a shiny bomb caseing full of used pinball machine parts!",
        "Crazy drunk driver.",
        "Damn! I'm late for school!",
        "Dear Dr. Brown. On the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.",
        "Don't be so gullible, McFly. Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.",
        "Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.",
        "Give me a Pepsi Free.",
        "Great Scott!",
        "He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life!",
        "He's a Peeping Tom!",
        "He's an absolute dream!",
        "He's an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too. Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I'll disown you.",
        "Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly. Think! I gotta have time to get them retyped. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen, would ya? Would ya?",
        "Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver. Dork thinks he's gonna drown.",
        "Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked!",
        "Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!",
        "Hey, hey, listen, guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?",
        "Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here.",
        "Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!",
        "I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!",
        "I finally invent something that works!",
        "I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.",
        "I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible.",
        "I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?",
        "I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don't have a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!",
        "I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.",
        "I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.",
        "I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.",
        "I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!",
        "I've never seen purple underwear before!",
        "If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.",
        "If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.",
        "It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!",
        "It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.",
        "Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.",
        "Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.",
        "Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.",
        "Let's see if you bastards can do 90.",
        "Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.",
        "Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, or anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.",
        "Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history.",
        "Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O.",
        "Lorraine. My density has brought me to you.",
        "Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.",
        "Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.",
        "Marty, will we ever see you again?",
        "Maybe you were adopted.",
        "My equipment. That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility of overload.",
        "Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!",
        "No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.",
        "No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!",
        "No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!",
        "No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.",
        "No, no, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.",
        "Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.",
        "Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.",
        "Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.",
        "Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!",
        "Oh, that's Joey. He cries when we take him out so we just leave him in there.",
        "Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug... go easy on him.",
        "Okay, thank you. That's enough. Hold it now. Hold it. Hold it, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Bring in the next group, please.",
        "Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right.",
        "Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!",
        "Radiation suit? Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.",
        "Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.",
        "Save the clock tower!",
        "Scram, McFly. I'm cuttin' in.",
        "See you in about 30 years.",
        "See you later, Pop. Whoo! Time to change that oil.",
        "Silence, Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!",
        "Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?",
        "Since you're new here, I-I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?",
        "So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.",
        "Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?",
        "Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car! Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!",
        "Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!",
        "That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?",
        "The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.",
        "The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?",
        "There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?",
        "Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far the eye could see. Old man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.",
        "This is all wrong. I don't know what it is. But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing... my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?",
        "Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?",
        "We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads.",
        "Weight has nothing to do with it.",
        "Well, I figured, what the hell?",
        "Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.",
        "What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?",
        "What are you looking at, butthead?",
        "What happens to us in the future? Do we become assholes or something?",
        "What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say 'Get outta here, kid. You got no future'? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man!",
        "What-what the hell is a gigawatt?",
        "Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?",
        "Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?",
        "Whoa. This is heavy.",
        "Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?",
        "Yeah, well, history is gonna change.",
        "Yes. Yes. I'm George. George McFly. I'm your density. I mean, your destiny.",
        "You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass.",
        "You got a real attitude problem, McFly; you're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here; he was a slacker, too.",
        "You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?",
        "You really think I ought to swear?",
        "You want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.",
        "You're late! Do you have no concept of time?"

        "I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth of hell, and it's gonna swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me. We're not ready? They're not ready.",
        "There is only one thing on this earth more powerful than evil. And that's us.",
        "So what — are we helpless puppets? No. The big moments are gonna come. You can't help that. It's what you do afterwards that counts. That's when you find out who you are.",
        "When it's really something that matters, they fight. I mean, they're lame morons for fighting, but they do. They never— they never quit. And so I guess I will keep fighting, too.",

        "A good Sunnydale rule-of-thumb? Avoid white-skinned men in capes.",
        "I can kill a couple of geeks all by myself. But, hey, if you'd like to watch... I mean, that's what you Watchers are good at, right? Watching?",
        "I'm talking! Don't interrupt me! Insignificant man. I am Willow. I am death. If you dare defy me, I will call down my fury, exact fresh vengeance, and make your worst fears come true. Okay?",
        "Just because you're better than us doesn't mean you can be all superior.",
        "You should never hurt the feelings of a brutal killer. You know, that's, uh, that's actually some pretty good advice.",
        "A vampire isn't a person at all. It may have the movements, the memories, even the personality of the person it took over, but it's a demon at the core. There is no halfway.",

          "True power is not just physical. Still, that hurt, didn't it?",
          "I have inflicted no grave injuries. Go now and recover.",
          "I used to think of this power as a curse, but now I appreciate it.",
          "I believe in the power of humanity.",
          "I'm so tired... I can hardly wait to relax with a nice bubble bath.",
          "That's all for today's lesson.",
          "I sense a strength within you. We will meet again.",
          "Victory is mine, but there is always next time. Shall I foresee the outcome?",
          "You are not cut out to be a fighter. It would be wise to seek another path.",
          "Embrace your destiny.",
          "Are you hurt?",
          "Man, I've gotten so famous lately that I can't even walk around outside anymore without people tryin' to ask for my autograph! I'm thinkin' maybe I need a bodyguard or somethin'! For real!",
          "So I was wonderin'... What's the difference between an ocean an' a sea, anyway? Is it just about size? Does the location matter? Can a sea get promoted to an ocean if it tries really hard?",
          "There ain't nothin I like more than a nice custom bike. It ain't just about the obvious stuff like color and shape, either. Ya gotta worry about the overall balance an' make sure it looks...",
          "I drove to China on my bike the other day. What? I ain't lyin', man! I never lie! I totally drove there on my bike! Don't belive me? Check a map! I'll retrace my steps for ya!",
          "Hobbies? Karaoke, baby! Can't get enough of it! One time Candy an' me, we rented out a karaoke box for a whole week! That was a blast! We're still payin' the owner for the busted speakers...",
          "I ain't just a legend in the fighting world, ya know. I'm also well-known in biker circles! Prolly considered the top biker in America! But I got my sights set even higher! One day, I'll...",
          "Candy's really into gardening lately. Ya know those little onion-lookin' things? They kinda look like me? Oh yeah! Bulbs! So, she planted a buncha bulbs in the garden, see? An' before long...",
          "Wanna know what I like most about Candy? Too bad! That's top secret privileged information, bub! I don't want you fallin' in love with her, too! Not that you could compete, but still...",
          "Why do women take so long to shop, anyway? Don't tell Candy I said this, but that girl took like 2 hours to decide between a couple of blouses that were the exact same color! No difference!",
          "Wataaah!",
          "Achoo!",
          "My journey to become the ultimate fighter has only just begun.",
          "Each time I fight, I learn something new. This journey has been fruitful.",
          "Even if my fists were to turn to dust, I would not give up in my quest!",
          "The more I learn, the more I realize how far I am from the end of my journey.",
          "The power I am after is the power to win - not the power to destroy!",
          "You must defeat my Shoryuken to stand a chance!",
          "No need to speak. Your fists told me everything I need to know about you.",
          "If you go into the ring expecting to fail, you will. Believe in yourself!",
          "Power alone is no guarantee of victory. Keep your eyes on your opponent!",
          "Give it your all!",
          "These two fists are everything to me!",
          "Do not place so much importance on winning. The fight itself has value.",
          "A strong fighter is not one who always wins, but one who stands after defeat.",
          "All the worlds fighters must bow before the undisputed king!",
          "I'm inspired by the courage of those who have fallen before my mighty fist.",
          "I will not rest until I know the meaning of the fight!",
          "They call me the king for a reason fool! You never stood a chance!",
          "Have you tested him in battle as well? Impressive, I shall remember you.",
          "You are not strong enough to go toe to toe with the undisputed king!",
          "You are not a warrior, you're a beginner.",
          "Stand up!",
          "Now you know the power of the king!",
          "Training is fun if you set your mind to a specific goal to work toward!",
          "Yes! I'm doing great! Gotta keep this up!",
          "Awesome fight! I'm on top of my game today!",
          "Oh no! I almost forgot I'm s'posed to meet Kei today! I'm gonna be late!",
          "I got some kind of invitation in the mail from Karin. I'd better reply!",
          "Yeah! That was great!",
          "That was so fun! We have to do it again soon!",
          "Phew! That was a close one! Wanna go again?",
          "You're pretty strong, but you need to mix up your moves a bit more.",
          "Thanks for fighting me!",
          "That's a wrap!",
          "Evil? Like the concept of gods, this is a meaningless human construct.",
          "No need to contemplate your future. That is for me to determine. Not you.",
          "My name, my consciousness, my power...Everything I have, I earned for myself!",
          "I was just looking for a test subject to assist in augmenting my engine...",
          "Before long, a new age will dawn upon the earth and I shall rule over all!",
          "Fear in the face of such power is only natural. No need to hide it.",
          "I am impressed. Now stand so that I may assimilate your data!",
          "I did not expect you to put up such a fight. You have impressed me.",
          "This has been a complete waste of time. Prepare for data deletion!",
          "My name is Seth. Remember it!",
          "I am ruler of all I survey!",
          "You cannot defeat me if you fight only for yourself.",
          "These fists fight for life. They are protected by benevolent spirits.",
          "Let us go to the ends of the earth!",
          "True warriors know no fear. This is not pride, but merely confidence.",
          "My power is bestowed upon me by the spirits. You have no such power!",
          "Spirits and men are both engaged in a constant journey.",
          "I do not fear death. But do not confuse this for resignation.",
          "Do not lament over your loss, for the spirits will heal and rejuvenate you.",
          "I will not stop until I have found my beloved and hold her in my arms!",
          "Let us depart.",
          "The wind speaks to us.",
          "No one compares to my beauty. Nor my strength.",
          "Not even the gods could create something that compares to my beauty.",
          "Blood is the most beautiful color known to mankind.",
          "Power and wealth are meaningless in the face of blinding beauty.",
          "I look the most beautiful when glimpsed in the moment of your demise.",
          "I am at my most beautiful when I am dealing the victory blow.",
          "The least I could do is defeat you with unmatched beauty and grace.",
          "Fighting ugly opponents depresses me to no end.",
          "The weak have nothing to offer and should be culled from the population.",
          "I am beautiful.",
          "Victory is beautiful.",
          "Choosing to fight me means that you are prepared to face defeat!",
          "My muscles are my shield and this shield can withstand any attack!",
          "Compared to my training in Siberia, street fights are mere child's play!",
          "Fans are what drive a wrestler's spirit! With support from my fans, I can't lose!",
          "If you want to build your leg muscles, you should try the Cossack Dance!",
          "I am the Red Cylcone and I destroy anything in my path!",
          "You'd better not try to stand up right away. I threw you awfully hard...",
          "That last move was impressive, comrade. But it was too little, too late!",
          "You need more muscle mass!",
          "You have to want victory!",

          "The more we study our inner light, the more profound becomes the outer darkness.",

          "Awake O Dead, for there can be no rest for ye beneath the earth. Let the splintered bones burrow from the grave pall. Let cold fingers grip time-worn blades, and unseeing eyes survey the fields of slaughter. For your time has come once more. And the dead shall walk.",
          "Athel Loren shall not suffer the presence of Men, nor Orcs, nor Dwarfs, nor Beastmen. If a foe takes a single step upon such sacred soil, they shall not take another.",
          "The new mountains gave us shelter... We made fire in their mouths... The tribes split the lands... The Tyrants roared and fought... There were many kingdoms... It was good for many winters... The tribes grew and grew too much. Now we follow the sun once more...",
          "The Ogres were born long ago... Big, strong and fat... The little round ones by our side... We ate and drank till our guts filled...",

          "The Maw was born from the fire... The earth shook at its coming... The flames ate many tribes... To the mountains some fled...",
          "The hungry flame sat in our guts...We ate the mountains to put it out... but the fire was still there...We climbed further still...We ate the Tall Ones' herds... Cavebeast was good meat... We climbed the peaks... Above the skies the giants dwell...",
          "Thinlings came in great wheel huts... We ate them and took the shinny things..."

        "We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!",
        "Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon... what've you got left?",

        "There is no Dana, there is only Zuul.",
        "Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947.",
        "You're very handy, I can tell. I bet you like to read a lot, too.",
        "Oh, that's very fascinating to me. I read a lot myself. Some people think I'm too intellectual but I think it's a fabulous way to spend your spare time. I also play racquetball. Do you have any hobbies?",

        "The whole building is a huge, superconductive antenna that was designed and built expressly for the purpose of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence. Your girlfriend lives in the corner penthouse... of Spook Central.",

        "I feel like the floor of a taxi cab.",
        "As they say in T.V., I'm sure there's one big question on everybody's mind, and I imagine you are the man to answer that. How is Elvis, and have you seen him lately?",
        "Hee hee hee! 'Get her!'' That was your whole plan, huh, 'get her.' Very scientific.",
        "OK... so... she's a dog...",
        "Ray, pretend for a moment that I don't know anything about metallurgy, engineering, or physics, and just tell me what the hell is going on.",
        "I'm gonna take back some of the things I said about you, Egon.",
        "Tell him about the Twinkie.",
        "Sir, what you had there is what we refer to as a focused, non-terminal, repeating phantasm or a class-five full-roaming vapor. A real nasty one, too.",
        "Coming through! One class-five full-roaming vapor. Move 'em out.",
        "Hey, wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold it! Now, are we actually gonna go before a federal judge, and tell him that some moldy Babylonian god is going to drop in on Central Park West, and start tearing up the city?",
        "You know, you don't act like a scientist.",
        "You're more like a game show host.",
        "Well, this is great. If the ionization-rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities, we can really bust some heads... in a spiritual sense, of course.",
        "I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people.",
        "Some moron brought a cougar to a party and it went berserk.",
        "And then she threw me out of her life. She thought I was a creep, she thought I was a geek, and she probably wasn't the first.",
        "I think this building should be condemned. There's serious metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members, the wiring is substandard, it's completely inadequate for our power needs, and the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone.",
        "Wow. This place is great. When can we move in? You gotta try this pole. I'm gonna get my stuff. Hey. We should stay here. Tonight. Sleep here. You know, to try it out.",

        "I'm studying the effects of negative reinforcement on ESP ability",
        "Let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area. According to this morning's sample, it would be a twinkie... 35 feet long and weighing approximately 600 pounds.",
        "That's a big Twinkie.",
        "We could on the verge of a fourfold cross-reap. A P.K.E. surge of incredible, even dangerous proportions!",

        "Uhhh... this magnificent feast here represents the LAST of the petty cash.",
        "Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable. You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman!",
        "I think we can get her a guest shot on 'Wild Kingdom.' I just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of Thorazaine... she's gonna take a little nap now.",
        "Everybody can relax, I found the car. Needs some suspension work and shocks. Brakes, brake pads, lining, steering box, transmission, rear-end.",
        "Maybe now you'll never slime a guy with a positron collider, huh?",
        "So, what are we doing today, Zuul?",
        "We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.",
        "We've neutronized it, you know what that means? A complete particle reversal.",
        "We have the tools, and we have the talent!",
        "Okay, Ghostbusters. The mayor wants to see you guys. The whole island's going crazy. Let's go.",
        "The structure of this roof cap is exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker that NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in deep space.",
        "Nobody ever made them like this! The architect was either a certified genius, or an authentic wacko.",
        "Nice thinking, Ray.",
        "It's true, your honor. The man is some kind of rodent, I don't know which.",
        "Is it just a mist, or does it have arms and legs?",

        "I love heroes, but I don't want to be one. Do you even know what a hero is!? For example, you have some meat. Pirates will feast on the meat, but the hero will distribute it among the people! I want to eat the meat!",
        "Don't ever think there's any perfect society made by humans!! If you think that way you'll overlook the enemy!! Don't be fooled by appearances!",
        "If I can't even protect my captain's dream, then whatever ambition I have is nothing but talk! Luffy must be the man who becomes the Pirate King!",
        "Old man, everyone!! And you.. Luffy. Even though I've been good for nothing my whole life, even though I have the blood of a demon within me... You guys still loved me! Thank you so much!!",
        "Compared to the \"righteous\" greed of the rulers, the criminals of the world seem much more honorable. When scum rules the world, only more scum is born.",
        "Pirates are evil? The Marines are righteous?... Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins this war becomes justice!",
        "When do you think people die? When they are shot through the heart by the bullet of a pistol? No. When they are ravaged by an incurable disease? No... It’s when they're forgotten!",
        "You can spill drinks on me, even spit on me. I'll just laugh about it. But If you dare to hurt my friends... I won't forgive you!",
        "The government says your existence is a crime, but no matter what kind of weapons you may hold, just being alive isn't a sin! There's no crime in living!",
        "ONE PIECE IS REAL!",
        "It's not some sort of special power. He has the ability to make allies of everyone he meets. And that is the most fearsome ability on the high seas.",
        "I want to live!",
        "Maybe nothing in this world happens by accident. As everything happens for a reason, our destiny slowly takes form.",
        "Food is a gift from god. Spices are a gift from the devil. It looks like it was a bit too spicy for you.",
        "I don't care now. I wanted to look like a human because I wanted friends. Now I want to be a monster who's helpful to Luffy!",
        "Miracles only happen to those who never give up.",
        "Stop counting only those things you have lost! What is gone, is gone! So ask yourself this. What is there... that still remains to you?!",
        "If you want to protect something, do it right! Don't let them get their way anymore!",
        "The royalty and nobles are behind the fire... Believe me... This town smells worse than Gray Terminal. It smells like rotten people! If I stay here... I'll never be free! I'm... ashamed to be born a noble!",
        "There comes a time when a man has to stand and fight! That time is when his friends' dreams are being laughed at! And I won't let you laugh at that!",
        "To true friendship, how long you've known each other means nothing.",
        "When the world shoves you around, you just gotta stand up and shove back. It's not like somebody's gonna save you if you start babbling excuses.",
        "People's dreams... Never end!",
        "If you kill yourself, I'll kill you!",

        "I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary goal in design.",
        "From the viewpoint of what you can do, therefore, languages do differ - but the differences are limited. For example, Python and Ruby provide almost the same power to the programmer.",
        "The orthogonal features, when combined, can explode into complexity.",
        "I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python.",
        "Because of the Turing completeness theory, everything one Turing-complete language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing-complete language, but at a different cost. You can do everything in assembler, but no one wants to program in assembler anymore.",
        "Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing. I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall, who is my hero actually. I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the freedom to choose.",
        "You want to enjoy life, don't you? If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun, that's good isn't it? That's the purpose of life, partly. Your life is better.",
        "People are different. People choose different criteria. But if there is a better way among many alternatives, I want to encourage that way by making it comfortable. So that's what I've tried to do.",
        "In our daily lives as programmers, we process text strings a lot. So I tried to work hard on text processing, namely the string class and regular expressions. Regular expressions are built into the language and are very tuned up for use.",
        "Most of the tasks we do are for humans. For example, a tax calculation is counting numbers so the government can pull money out from my wallet, but government consists of humans.",
        "Actually, I didn't make the claim that Ruby follows the principle of least surprise. Someone felt the design of Ruby follows that philosophy, so they started saying that. I didn't bring that up, actually.",
        "Smart people underestimate the ordinarity of ordinary people.",
        "Language designers want to design the perfect language. They want to be able to say, 'My language is perfect. It can do everything.' But it's just plain impossible to design a perfect language, because there are two ways to look at a language. One way is by looking at what can be done with that language. The other is by looking at how we feel using that language-how we feel while programming.",
        "I believe that the purpose of life is, at least in part, to be happy. Based on this belief, Ruby is designed to make programming not only easy but also fun. It allows you to concentrate on the creative side of programming, with less stress.",
        "Most programs are not write-once. They are reworked and rewritten again and again in their lived. Bugs must be debugged. Changing requirements and the need for increased functionality mean the program itself may be modified on an ongoing basis. During this process, human beings must be able to read and understand the original code. It is therefore more important by far for humans to be able to understand the program than it is for the computer.",
        "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.",
        "Man is driven to create; I know I really love to create things. And while I'm not good at painting, drawing, or music, I can write software.",
        "It is not the responsibility of the language to force good looking code, but the language should make good looking code possible.",
        "Plant a memory, plant a tree, do it today for tomorrow.",
        "Imagine you are writing an email. You are in front of the computer. You are operating the computer, clicking a mouse and typing on a keyboard, but the message will be sent to a human over the internet. So you are working before the computer, but with a human behind the computer.",
        "Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines.",
        "Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, 'I was surprised by this feature of the language, so therefore Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.' Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only.",
        "Sometimes people jot down pseudo-code on paper. If that pseudo-code runs directly on their computers, its best, isn't it? Ruby tries to be like that, like pseudo-code that runs. Python people say that too."

        "Brand new. Great design. Odd to hear pop music in a Mexican establishment. Music is a bit loud. It should be background.",
        "The chicken nachos were delicious and the atmosphere was great. The frozen margaritas were a little on the weak side. Would probably return for a work happy hour but was pretty disappointed about the lack of free tequila and beer we read about!",
        "The counter is on the left side, and so is the menu. It can get pretty busy with 30 min wait times. I recommend checking the website and see how busy their store is.",
        "They are way understaffed, where the cashier needs to stop taking orders to help pack to-go orders. The line ends up piling up and people are neglected.  Seen this happen multiple times during lunch hours.",
        "This particular location like the many other restaurants down the block has ample seating and a second floor.",
        "I first heard about this place through Instagram post. The drinks looked creative so I made it a point to give it try while in the city. Located inside American Eagle in Times Square they serve up the coolest non-alcoholic beverages. You have an array of options from tea, soda, coffee, latte, water and more. Theres countertops (with phone chargers) so youre able to stand and enjoy your beverage. This visit I opted for the Pegasus latte which was not only beautiful but tasted just as good as it looked. Great staff and great service. This is a must try if you are in the area. Im sure Ill be back soon!",
        "Great place to stop in from a chaotic Times Square adventure! The coffee is great, the drinks are creative and the staff is very nice and hospitable. Cant wait to stop in again. Without a doubt 5 stars from me!!",
        "Great lattes and cold drinks as well. Nice to see a place carrying local coffee and products in Times Square! Excited to make it a part of my morning commute as it is much less crowded than the chain coffee shops around here.",
        "Fish was high quality but portions were small. $57 for 9 pieces and a hand roll which is fair but on the expensive side.",
        "Ambience was good, service was no nonsense but friendly.",
        "Id have to say that each piece was fresh and had their own slight unique flavor twist to it, pushing the line between traditional edomae and fusion. The Hokkaido uni and the ocean trout topped with cook seaweed was the highlights of the meal. But each piece served was really something special.",
        "Staff was very accommodating but the chef were no nonsense. The ambiance is clean and tranquil which is perfect if youre looking to have a conversation with a date or a friend.",
        "My only critique would be that the rice could of used more vingaer and for them to use real wasabi. Also the variety of fish in stock wasnt a lot but hopefully that can change over time. The cost justify the quality youre getting. A solid 4 stars.",
        "In terms of omakase, they had a few options but the one we chose was the 87 dollar version which include sashimi and sushi."

        "You know what I love most about Mars? They still dream. We gave up. They're an entire culture dedicated to a common goal, working together as one to turn a lifeless rock into a garden. We had a garden and we paved it.",
        "My great uncle emigrated from Earth. He missed it terribly. He used to tell me stories when I was a little boy about these... endless blue skies, free air everywhere, open water all the way to the horizon. He told me that someday we would make Mars just like that. When you spend your whole life living under a dome, even the idea of an ocean seems impossible to imagine. I could never understand your people. Why, when the universe has bestowed so much upon you, you seem to care so little for it?",
        "Do you know it is possible to cry so hard that your tears turn to blood? And living with this pain, I came to realize that I have millions of brothers and sisters in the Belt. I even count you among them.",
        "Remember the Cant!",

        "I met your mother, Alice. When everyone else said you were a terrorist I went to find out for myself. Lovely woman. She thought I was full of shit, too, at first. She's well, happy for you, happy you're free. She told me when you were a boy, you wanted to be a knight.",
        "This isn't just about the war, we need to contain the protomolecule, make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands!",
        "When I first saw that thing outside, for a split second I thought I was hallucinating. But after hearing what went down in that lab, now I wish I kinda had been.",

        "Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?",
        "Hello, IT. Ya ha? Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?",
        "I'll just put it here with the rest of the fire.",
        "Yes, there is. I am sick of my things going walkabout. With this picture, everyone knows that a certain Mr Moss might be looking for his cup.",
        "Ugh, OK, well the button on the side, is it glowing?... Yeah, you need to turn it on. Erm, the button turns it on. Yeah, you... you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes.",
        "See. the driver hooks the function by patching the system call table, so it's not safe to unload it unless another thread's about to jump in and do its stuff, and you don't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory... Hello?",
        "An ill wind is blowing. Last night I was stirred from my slumber by a crow calling three times. Caw... caw... well you know what a crow sounds like. Passing to my window, I trod on a piece of lego. Oh, it went right in the heel. Turning on my television set, I noticed the reception wasn't great. Not terrible, just not great. Hear me well, no good can come of your trip to the theatre tonight, no good at all. And if you ask me... That's just bloody rude. Where's my Heat?",
        "I don't know if it's the loss of blood or the melting plastic from the monitor, but I feel great!",
        "Didn't know what a stress machine as this morning, and now we have two of them.",
        "Now, let's see what we have here. 'Stand upright.' Well now I can't read it. Oh, not me. I AM a giddy goat.",
        "Jen, if this needle goes past here, you're fired. Does that make you feel stressed at all? Does it? Jen? Are you sure? Jen? Does it? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure?",
        "I used to work as a waiter. If anyone was ever rude to me, I used to carry their food around in my trousers.",
        "Would I blow everyone's mind if I ate dessert first?",
        "It's a bucket of fried chicken. And it comes in a real bucket.",
        "Yes, I believe it was Tolstoy who said... Oh, it appears we have a visitor. I'm sorry, myself and Maurice were engaged in quite a serious discussion about books and such. We didn't hear you come in.",
        "Why are you speaking in that weird voice? When did...? I don't remember this conversation AT ALL.",
        "There's nothing sexual about it, I mean I like Roy, but I'm not 'Curious'.",
        "So, what brings you to my lair? Not that I'm some sort of animal. Or, or maybe I am.",
        "Oh look, Richmond's still alive.",
        "My middle name is ready. No, that doesn't sound right. I eat ready for breakfast.",
        "Fire. Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire that has broken out on the premises of 123 Cavendon Road... no, that's too formal. Fire - exclamation mark - fire - exclamation mark - help me - exclamation mark. 123 Cavendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours truly, Maurice Moss.",
        "I don't like goat's anything. I don't like goats being involved in any stage of the food production process.",
        "This flipping circuit board, Jen. Some chump has run the data lines right through the power supply. Amateur hour! I've got tears in my eyes!",
        "They're fairly regular the beatings, yes. I'd say we're on a Bi-weekly beating",
        "OK, lady! You've won this round! But we can wait. You will slip up one day. And believe you me, we will be there when you do. There will be some piece of evidence that will prove without any shadow of a doubt that you don't know anything about computers!",
        "Team! Team, team, team, team, team! I even love saying the word 'team'. You probably think that's a picture of my family. Uh uh. It's the A-Team! Bodie, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man.",
        "Why are you giving me the secret signal to shut up?",
        "Oh, it's just water. Sometimes I get a hot ear, and this helps cool it down. She is quite the oddball.",
        "I hope this doesn't embarrass you, Jen, but I find the best thing to do with a new employee is to size them up with a long, hard stare...",
        "That's the sort of place this is, Jen. A lot of sexy people, not doing much work and having affairs!",
        "Well, don't take this the wrong way, but could he have thought you were a man?",
        "Ah! The IT-department. Run by a dynamic go-getter, a genius and a man from Ireland.",
        "You wouldn't shoot a Policeman and then steal his helmet. You wouldn't go to the toilet in his helmet, and then send it to the Policeman's grieving widow, and then steal it again. Downloading films is stealing; if you do it you WILL face the consequences!",
        "Ah, well, prepare to put mustard on those words, for you will soon be consuming them along with this slice of humble pie that comes direct from the oven of shame set at gas mark 'egg on your face'! I sort of forget what I was talking about.",
        "Oh... morning. Oh my word. When did the English start drinking like that? You people drink like you don't want to live.",
        "You best put seat belts on your ears, Roy, 'cause I'm going to take them for the ride of their life!",
        "Listen, Alistair, I just wanted to say, I'm not a window cleaner. No, no, I work in IT. Yeah, yeah, with computers and all that. Macs? No, I just really work with Windows. Hello?",
        "I'm a 32 year old IT consultant who works in the basement. Yes, I do the whole lonely hearts thing.",
        "I only know one woman and she just left the room shouting 'The shoes!'",
        "Nice screensaver. I love the way the smoke seems to be coming off the top of it...",
        "A plan. Let me put on my slightly larger glasses.",
        "Hello? What? Well if you can't work as a team you're all fired. That's it, you heard me, fired! Get your things and go. Hello, security? Everyone on floor 4 is fired. Escort them from the premises. And do it as a team. Remember, you're a team and if you can't act as a team, you're fired too. Dom, get on to recruitment. Get them to look for a security team that can work as a team. They may have to escort the current security team from the building for not acting like a team.",
        "Never been. But I've always liked the idea of the theatre. The smell of the grease, the roar of the paint. I've often thought if I hadn't ended up in computers, I would've gone into the theatre.",
        "If this evening is going to work in any way, you need to pretend to be normal people, yeah? Keep the conversation about things that would interest everybody. You know, nothing about memory, or RAM.",
        "Roy, I spoke to the Elders of the Internet not one hour ago. I told them about Jen winning Employee of the Month and they were so impressed that they wanted to do whatever they could to help.",
        "Well, I'm the boss... Head Honcho. El Numero Uno. Mr. Big. The Godfather. Lord of the Rings. The Bourne... Identity. Er... Taxi Driver. Jaws. I forgot the question quite a while back. Who are you, again?",
        "Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them! Actually, that doesn't work as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages.",
        "Did you notice how she didn't even get excited when she saw this original ZX81?",
        "Shut up, do what I tell you, I'm not interested; these are just some of the things you'll be hearing if you answer this ad. I'm an idiot and I don't care about anyone but myself. P.S. No dogs!",
        "Oh, I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality.",
        "I'm sorry for your loss. Move on.",
        "It's not like you've lost a pen, is it? It's so much worse. Would you like a pen? I have a spare one.",
        "With all due respect John, I am the head of IT and I have it on good authority that if you type 'Google' into Google, you can break the Internet. So please, no one try it, even for a joke. It's not a laughing matter. You can break the Internet.",
        "Even if that were true, it's just not in their nature to learn how to use a ladder! They have wings! When a moth thinks about travelling vertically upwards, a ladder is just the last thing they would think of! Moss, I don't like to be negative about it, but everything you invent is worthless!",
        "You want me to open it. That's why you called me all the way up here, to open your laptop?",
        "Well, if someone called me a 'big, ugly builder', I'd be furious - and not just because I'm actually an IT consultant. Revenge, that would be uppermost on my mind: 'I'm going to wee on everything. I'm going to taint her abode. I'm going to strain my personal potatoes throughout her premises.'",
        "Just promise me we won't do anything else with them. I want to go back to being weird. I like being weird. Weird is all I've got. That and my sweet style.",
        "Balloons explode, Jen. They explode suddenly, and unexpectedly. They are filled with the capacity to give me a little fright, and I find that unbearable.",
        "I came here to drink milk and kick ass. And I've just finished my milk."

I was so nervous that when the cashier asked me for my money, I dropped it. My friend picked it up and handed it to me. She looked at me right in the eyes... didn't recognize me. I guess whatever you did to me worked better than I imagined.",

        "I'm afraid that won't work either. Now, you have to understand, Evey. I don't want this for either of us, but I couldn't see any other way. You were unconscious, and I had to make a decision. If I had left you there, right now, you'd be in one of Creedy's interrogation cells. They'd imprison you, torture you, and, in all probability, kill you in the pursuit of finding me. After what you did, I couldn't let that happen, so I picked you up and carried you to the only place I knew you'd be safe: here, to my home.",

        "It's funny. I was given one of your roses today. I wasn't sure you were the terrorist until I saw it. What a strange coincidence that I should be given one today.",

        "No. I shouldn't have done that. I must have been out of my mind.",
        "Not so funny now is it, funny man?",
        "Now that's done with. It's time to have a look at your face. Take off your mask.",

        "Sutler can no longer trust you, can he, Mr. Creedy? And we both know why. After I destroy Parliament, his only chance will be to offer them someone else. Some other piece of meat. And who will that be? You, Mr. Creedy. A man as smart as you has probably considered this. A man as smart as you probably has a plan. That plan is the reason Sutler no longer trusts you. It's the reason why you're being watched right now, why there are eyes and ears in every room of this house and a tap on every phone.",
        "Sutler. Come now, Mr. Creedy, you knew this was coming. You knew that one day, it'd be you or him. That's why Sutler's been kept underground, for 'security purposes'. That's why there are several of your men close to Sutler. Men that could be counted on. All you have to do is say the word.",
        "Tell me... do you like music, Mr. Finch?",
        "Thank you... but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds.",
        "That's it! See, at first I thought it was hate, too. Hate was all I knew, it built my world, it imprisoned me, taught me how to eat, how to drink, how to breathe. I thought I'd die with all my hate in my veins. But then something happened. It happened to me... just as it happened to you.",
        "The Ghost of Christmas past.",
        "The only thing that you and I have in common, Mr. Creedy, is we're both about to die.",
        "The problem is, he knows us better than we know ourselves. That's why I went to Larkhill, last night.",
        "The time has come for me to meet my maker and to repay him in kind for all that he's done.",
        "Then you have no fear anymore. You're completely free.",

        "This so called V and his accomplice Evey Hammond, neo-demagogues spouting their message of hate, a delusional and aberrant voice delivering a terrorist's ultimatum... An ultimatum that was met with swift, surgically precise justice! The moral of this story ladies and gentleman is... Good guys win, bad guys lose, and as always, England prevails!",
        "Tonight's your big night. Are you ready for it?... Are we ready for it?",

If your information leads to his capture, you will be released from this facility immediately. Do you understand what I'm telling you? You can return to your life, Miss Hammond. All you have to do is cooperate.",

        "Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.",
        "I know there's no way I can convince you this is not one of their tricks, but I don't care, I am me. My name is Valerie, I don't think I'll live much longer and I wanted to tell someone about my life. This is the only autobiography I'll ever write, and god, I'm writing it on toilet paper. I was born in Nottingham in 1985, I don't remember much of those early years, but I do remember the rain. My grandmother owned a farm in Tuttlebrook, and she use to tell me that god was in the rain. I passed my 11th lesson into girl's grammar; it was at school that I met my first girlfriend, her name was Sara. It was her wrists. They were beautiful. I thought we would love each other forever. I remember our teacher telling us that is was an adolescent phase people outgrew. Sara did, I didn't. In 2002, I fell in love with a girl named Christina. That year I came out to my parents. I couldn't have done it without Chris holding my hand. My father wouldn't look at me, he told me to go and never come back. My mother said nothing. But I had only told them the truth, was that so selfish? Our integrity sells for so little, but it is all we really have. It is the very last inch of us, but within that inch, we are free. I'd always known what I wanted to do with my life, and in 2015 I starred in my first film, 'The Salt Flats'. It was the most important role of my life, not because of my career, but because that was how I met Ruth. The first time we kissed, I knew I never wanted to kiss any other lips but hers again. We moved to a small flat in London together. She grew Scarlet Carsons for me in our window box, and our place always smelled of roses. Those were there best years of my life. But America's war grew worse, and worse. And eventually came to London. After that there were no roses anymore. Not for anyone. I remember how the meaning of words began to change. How unfamiliar words like 'collateral' and 'rendition' became frightening. While things like Norse Fire and The Articles of Allegiance became powerful, I remember how different became dangerous. I still don't understand it, why they hate us so much. They took Ruth while she was out buying food. I've never cried so hard in my life. It wasn't long till they came for me. It seems strange that my life should end in such a terrible place, but for three years, I had roses, and apologized to no one. I shall die here. Every inch of me shall perish. Every inch, but one. An Inch, it is small and it is fragile, but it is the only thing the world worth having. We must never lose it or give it away. We must never let them take it from us. I hope that whoever you are, you escape this place. I hope that the world turns and that things get better. But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you. I love you. With all my heart, I love you. -Valerie",
        "Listen to me, Evey. This may be the most important moment of your life. Commit to it. They took your parents from you. They took your brother from you. They put you in a cell and took everything they could take except your life. And you believed that was all there was, didn't you? The only thing you had left was your life, but it wasn't, was it? You found something else. In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life. It was when they threatened to kill you unless you gave them what they wanted... you told them you'd rather die. You faced your death, Evey. You were calm. You were still. Try to feel now what you felt then.",
        "My fellow Englishmen: tonight our country, that which we stand for, and all we hold dear, faces a grave and terrible threat. This violent and unparalleled assault on our security will not go undefended... or unpunished. Our enemy is an insidious one, seeking to divide us and destroy the very foundation of our great nation. Tonight, we must remain steadfast. We must remain determined. But most of all, we must remain united. Those caught tonight in violation of curfew will be considered in league with our enemy and prosecuted as a terrorist without leniency or exception. Tonight, I give you my most solemn vow: that justice will be swift, it will be righteous, and it will be without mercy.",
        "Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young up-and-coming politician. He's a deeply religious man and a member of the conservative party. He is completely single-minded convictions and has no regard for the political process. Eventually, his party launches a special project in the name of 'national security'. At first, it is believed to be a search for biological weapons and it is pursued regardless of its cost. However, the true goal of the project is power, complete and total hegemonic domination. The project, however, ends violently... but the efforts of those involved are not in vain, for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of their victims. Imagine a virus - the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon? It is at this point in our story that along comes a spider. He is a man seemingly without a conscience; for whom the ends always justify the means and it is he who suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself. Three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack: a school, a tube station, and a water-treatment plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks. Until at last the true goal comes into view. Before the St. Mary's crisis, no one would have predicted the outcome of the elections. No one. But after the election, lo and behold, a miracle. Some believed that it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members made them all obscenely rich. But the true genius of the plan was the fear. A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty, and executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims. Fear became the ultimate tool of this government. And through it our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of High Chancellor. The rest, as they say, is history.",
        "Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot... But what of the man? I know his name was Guy Fawkes and I know, in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. But who was he really? What was he like? We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I've witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I've seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them... but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it... ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love... And it is not an idea that I miss, it is a man... A man that made me remember the Fifth of November. A man that I will never forget.",
        "So I read that the former United States is so desperate for medical supplies that they have allegedly sent several containers filled with wheat and tobacco. A gesture, they said, of good will. You wanna know what I think? Well, you're listening to my show, so I will assume you do... I think it's high time we let the colonies know what we really think of them. I think its payback time for a little tea party they threw for us a few hundred years ago. I say we go down to those docks tonight and dump that crap where everything from the Ulcered Sphincter of Arse-erica belongs! Who's with me? Who's bloody with me? Did you like that? USA... Ulcered Sphincter of Arse-erica, I mean what else can you say? Here was a country that had everything, absolutely everything. And now, 20 years later, is what? The world's biggest leper colony. Why? Godlessness. Let me say that again... Godlessness. It wasn't the war they started. It wasn't the plague they created. It was Judgement. No one escapes their past. No one escapes Judgement. You think he's not up there? You think he's not watching over this country? How else can you explain it? He tested us, but we came through. We did what we had to do. Islington. Enfield. I was there, I saw it all. Immigrants, Muslims, homosexuals, terrorists. Disease-ridden degenerates. They had to go. Strength through unity. Unity through faith. I'm a God-fearing Englishman and I'm goddamn proud of it!",
        "Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."

Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes.

A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away - to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless.",

Against this threat, upon the Jedi Knights falls the duty to lead the newly formed army of the Republic. And as the heat of war grows, so, to, grows the prowess of one most gifted student of the Force.",
