      # Phrase fields are an awesome dismax feature that adds extra boost to
      # documents for which all the fulltext keywords appear in close proximity

      #
      # Boosted fields are specified in a hash of field names to a boost, as
      # with the #fields and #boost_fields methods.

      # === Example
      #
      #   Sunspot.search(Post) do
      #     keywords 'nothing reveals like relevance' do
      #       phrase_fields :title => 2.0

      # are returned; only on what their respective boosts are.

      # 
      # Boost queries allow specification of an arbitrary scope for which
      # matching documents should receive an extra boost. You can either specify 
      # a boost factor and a block, or a boost function. The block is evaluated
      # in the usual scope DSL, and field names are attribute fields, not text
      # fields, as in other scope.
      #
      # The boost function can be a constant (numeric or string literal), 
      # a field name or another function. You can build arbitrarily complex 
      # functions, which are passed transparently to solr.
      #
      # This method can be called more than once for different boost queries
      # with different boosts.
      #
      # === Example
      #
      #   Sunspot.search(Post) do
      #     keywords 'super fan' do

      #       boost(function { sum(:average_rating, product(:popularity, 10)) })
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # In the above search, featured posts will receive a boost of 2.0 and all posts 
      # will be boosted by (average_rating + popularity * 10).
