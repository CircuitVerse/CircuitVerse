/*
  Customize RailsAdmin theme here.
  Copy this file to your app/assets/stylesheets/rails_admin/custom/theming.scss, leave this one untouched
  Don't require it in your application.rb

  Look at the markup in RailsAdmin and go there to get inspiration from:

  http://getbootstrap.com

  Test me: (actual color should be the one defined in variables.scss if you did)

  body { background-color: $link-color; }
