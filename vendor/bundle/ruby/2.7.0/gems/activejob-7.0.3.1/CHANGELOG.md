    Could cause `uninitialized constant ActiveJob::Arguments::BigDecimal (NameError)`
    when loading Active Job in isolation.

*   Allow testing `discard_on/retry_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError`

    Previously in `perform_enqueued_jobs`, `deserialize_arguments_if_needed`
    was called before calling `perform_now`. When a record no longer exists
    and is serialized using GlobalID this led to raising
    an `ActiveJob::DeserializationError` before reaching `perform_now` call.
    This behaviour makes difficult testing the job `discard_on/retry_on` logic.

    Now `deserialize_arguments_if_needed` call is postponed to when `perform_now`
    is called.

    Example:

    ```ruby
    class UpdateUserJob < ActiveJob::Base
      discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError

      def perform(user)
        # ...
      end
    end

    # In the test
    User.destroy_all
    assert_nothing_raised do
      perform_enqueued_jobs only: UpdateUserJob
    end
    ```

*   Remove deprecated `:return_false_on_aborted_enqueue` option.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Deprecated `Rails.config.active_job.skip_after_callbacks_if_terminated`.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Removed deprecated behavior that was not halting `after_enqueue`/`after_perform` callbacks when a
    previous callback was halted with `throw :abort`.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Raise an `SerializationError` in `Serializer::ModuleSerializer`
    if the module name is not present.

## Rails 7.0.0.alpha1 (September 15, 2021) ##

*   Allow a job to retry indefinitely

    The `attempts` parameter of the `retry_on` method now accepts the
    symbol reference `:unlimited` in addition to a specific number of retry
    attempts to allow a developer to specify that a job should retry
    forever until it succeeds.

        class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
          retry_on(AlwaysRetryException, attempts: :unlimited)

          # the actual job code
        end

    *Daniel Morton*

*   Added possibility to check on `:priority` in test helper methods
    `assert_enqueued_with` and `assert_performed_with`.

    *Wojciech Wnętrzak*

*   OpenSSL constants are now used for Digest computations.

    *Dirkjan Bussink*

*   Add a Serializer for the Range class.

    This should allow things like `MyJob.perform_later(range: 1..100)`.

*   Communicate enqueue failures to callers of `perform_later`.

    `perform_later` can now optionally take a block which will execute after
    the adapter attempts to enqueue the job. The block will receive the job
    instance as an argument even if the enqueue was not successful.
    Additionally, `ActiveJob` adapters now have the ability to raise an
    `ActiveJob::EnqueueError` which will be caught and stored in the job
    instance so code attempting to enqueue jobs can inspect any raised
    `EnqueueError` using the block.

        MyJob.perform_later do |job|
          unless job.successfully_enqueued?
            if job.enqueue_error&.message == "Redis was unavailable"
              # invoke some code that will retry the job after a delay
            end
          end
        end

    *Daniel Morton*

*   Don't log rescuable exceptions defined with `rescue_from`.

    *Hu Hailin*

*   Allow `rescue_from` to rescue all exceptions.

    *Adrianna Chang*, *Étienne Barrié*
