# Attachments associate records with blobs. Usually that's a one record-many blobs relationship,
# but it is possible to associate many different records with the same blob. A foreign-key constraint
# on the attachments table prevents blobs from being purged if theyâ€™re still attached to any records.
#
# Attachments also have access to all methods from {ActiveStorage::Blob}[rdoc-ref:ActiveStorage::Blob].
#
# If you wish to preload attachments or blobs, you can use these scopes:
#
#   # preloads attachments, their corresponding blobs, and variant records (if using `ActiveStorage.track_variants`)
#   User.all.with_attached_avatars
#
#   # preloads blobs and variant records (if using `ActiveStorage.track_variants`)
