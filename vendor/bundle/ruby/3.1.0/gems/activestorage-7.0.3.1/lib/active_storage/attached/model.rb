      # and +avatar_blob+. But you shouldn't need to work with these associations directly in
      # most circumstances.

      # proxy that provides the dynamic proxy to the associations and factory methods, like +attach+.
      #
      # If the +:dependent+ option isn't set, the attachment will be purged
      # (i.e. destroyed) whenever the record is destroyed.
      #
      # If you need the attachment to use a service which differs from the globally configured one,
