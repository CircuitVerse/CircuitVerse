# Third Party Notices

The New Relic Ruby agent may make use of source code from third party libraries
which carry their own copyright notices and license terms. Any such content will
be provided below.

In the event that a required notice is missing or incorrect, please notify us
by e-mailing [open-source@newrelic.com](mailto:open-source@newrelic.com).

For any licenses that require the disclosure of source
code, the source code can be found at:

## Current Notices and Terms

As of version 7.0 (released April 23, 2021), the New Relic Ruby agent does not
include any third party software with its distribution.

The Ruby agent team leverages a variety of open source third party software for
the development of the agent but not distributed with the agent. Some of these
software packages are referenced as development dependencies in the agent's
[newrelic_rpm.gemspec](newrelic_rpm.gemspec) file. We are grateful
to the maintainers and contributors for all of these packages.

For versions older than 7.0, please consult the `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
document distributed with the agent. Any version of the agent not containing
that document are not thought to include any third party software.
