# OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Helpers: SQL Obfuscation

This Ruby gem contains logic to obfuscate SQL. It's intended for use by by gem authors instrumenting SQL adapter libraries, such as mysql2, pg, and trilogy.

The logic is largely drawn from the [New Relic Ruby agent's SQL Obfuscation Helpers module][new-relic-obfuscation-helpers].

## Usage

Add the gem to your instrumentation's gemspec file:

```ruby
# opentelemetry-instrumentation-your-gem.gemspec
  spec.add_dependency 'opentelemetry-helpers-sql-obfuscation'
```

Add the gem to your instrumentation's Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile

group :test, :development do
  gem 'opentelemetry-helpers-sql-obfuscation', path: '../../helpers/sql-obfuscation'
end
```

Make sure the `Instrumentation` class for your gem contains configuration options for:

- `:obfuscation_limit`: the length at which the SQL string will not be obfuscated
  Example: `option :obfuscation_limit, default: 2000, validate: :integer`

If you want to add support for a new adapter, update the following constants to include keys for your adapter:

- `DIALECT_COMPONENTS`
- `CLEANUP_REGEX`

You must also add a new constant that calls the `generate_regex` method with your adapter's DIALECT_COMPONENTS that is named like `<ADAPTER>_COMPONENTS_REGEX`, such as: `MYSQL_COMPONENTS_REGEX`.

Check [New Relic's SQL Obfuscation Helpers module][new-relic-obfuscation-helpers] to see if regular expressions for your adapter already exist.

## Examples

To obfuscate sql in your library:

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::Helpers::SqlObfuscation.obfuscate_sql(sql, obfuscation_limit: config[:obfuscation_limit], adapter: :postgres)
```
