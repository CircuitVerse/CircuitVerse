# Flipper

> Beautiful, performant feature flags for Ruby and Rails.

Flipper gives you control over who has access to features in your app.

- Enable or disable features for everyone, specific actors, groups of actors, a percentage of actors, or a percentage of time.
- Configure your feature flags from the console or a web UI.
- Regardless of what data store you are using, Flipper can performantly store your feature flags.
- Use [Flipper Cloud](#flipper-cloud) to cascade features from multiple environments, share settings with your team, control permissions, keep an audit history, and rollback.

Control your software &mdash; don't let it control you.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'flipper'

You'll also want to pick a storage [adapter](https://flippercloud.io/docs/adapters), for example:

    gem 'flipper-active_record'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself with:

    $ gem install flipper

## Subscribe &amp; Ship

[ðŸ’Œ &nbsp;Subscribe](https://blog.flippercloud.io/#/portal/signup) - we'll send you short and sweet emails when we release new versions ([examples](https://blog.flippercloud.io/tag/releases/)).

## Getting Started

Use `Flipper#enabled?` in your app to check if a feature is enabled.

```ruby
# check if search is enabled
if Flipper.enabled?(:search, current_user)
  puts 'Search away!'
else
  puts 'No search for you!'
end
```

All features are disabled by default, so you'll need to explicitly enable them.

```ruby
# Enable a feature for everyone
Flipper.enable :search

# Enable a feature for a specific actor
Flipper.enable_actor :search, current_user

# Enable a feature for a group of actors
Flipper.enable_group :search, :admin

# Enable a feature for a percentage of actors
Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors :search, 2
```

## Flipper Cloud

Like Flipper and want more? Check out [Flipper Cloud](https://www.flippercloud.io?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=check_out), which comes with:

- **multiple environments** &mdash; production, staging, per continent, whatever you need. Every environment inherits from production by default and every project comes with a [project overview page](https://blog.flippercloud.io/project-overview/) that shows each feature and its status in each environment.
- **personal environments** &mdash; everyone on your team gets a personal environment (that inherits from production) which they can modify however they want without stepping on anyone else's toes.
- **permissions** &mdash; grant access to everyone in your organization or lockdown each project to particular people. You can even limit access to a particular environment (like production) to specific people.
- **audit history** &mdash; every feature change and who made it.
- **rollbacks** &mdash; enable or disable a feature accidentally? No problem. You can roll back to any point in the audit history with a single click.
- **maintenance** &mdash; we'll keep the lights on for you. We also have handy webhooks and background polling for keeping your app in sync with Cloud, so **our availability won't affect yours**. All your feature flag reads are local to your app.
- **everything in one place** &mdash; no need to bounce around from different application UIs or IRB consoles.

Cloud is super simple to integrate with Rails ([demo app](https://github.com/fewerandfaster/flipper-rails-demo)), Sinatra or any other framework.

We also have a [free plan](https://www.flippercloud.io?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=free_plan) that you can use forever.
