  # Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (\IMAP) client
  # functionality.  The protocol is described
  # in {IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501]
  # and {IMAP4rev2 [RFC9051]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051].
  #
  # == \IMAP Overview
  #
  # An \IMAP client connects to a server, and then authenticates
  # itself using either #authenticate or #login.  Having
  # authenticated itself, there is a range of commands
  # available to it.  Most work with mailboxes, which may be
  # arranged in an hierarchical namespace, and each of which
  # contains zero or more messages.  How this is implemented on
  # the server is implementation-dependent; on a UNIX server, it
  # will frequently be implemented as files in mailbox format
  # within a hierarchy of directories.
  #
  # To work on the messages within a mailbox, the client must
  # first select that mailbox, using either #select or #examine
  # (for read-only access).  Once the client has successfully
  # selected a mailbox, they enter the +selected+ state, and that
  # mailbox becomes the _current_ mailbox, on which mail-item
  # related commands implicitly operate.
  #
  # === Connection state
  #
  # Once an IMAP connection is established, the connection is in one of four
  # states: <tt>not authenticated</tt>, +authenticated+, +selected+, and
  # +logout+.  Most commands are valid only in certain states.
  #
  # See #connection_state.
  #
  # === Sequence numbers and UIDs
  #
  # Messages have two sorts of identifiers: message sequence
  # numbers and UIDs.
  #
  # Message sequence numbers number messages within a mailbox
  # from 1 up to the number of items in the mailbox.  If a new
  # message arrives during a session, it receives a sequence
  # number equal to the new size of the mailbox.  If messages
  # are expunged from the mailbox, remaining messages have their
  # sequence numbers "shuffled down" to fill the gaps.
  #
  # To avoid sequence number race conditions, servers must not expunge messages
  # when no command is in progress, nor when responding to #fetch, #store, or
  # #search.  Expunges _may_ be sent during any other command, including
  # #uid_fetch, #uid_store, and #uid_search.  The #noop and #idle commands are
  # both useful for this side-effect: they allow the server to send all mailbox
  # updates, including expunges.
  #
  # UIDs, on the other hand, are permanently guaranteed not to
  # identify another message within the same mailbox, even if
  # the existing message is deleted.  UIDs are required to
  # be assigned in ascending (but not necessarily sequential)
  # order within a mailbox; this means that if a non-IMAP client
  # rearranges the order of mail items within a mailbox, the
  # UIDs have to be reassigned.  An \IMAP client thus cannot
  # rearrange message orders.
  #
  # === Examples of Usage
  #
  # ==== List sender and subject of all recent messages in the default mailbox
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
  #   imap.authenticate('PLAIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
  #   imap.examine('INBOX')
  #   imap.search(["RECENT"]).each do |message_id|
  #     envelope = imap.fetch(message_id, "ENVELOPE")[0].attr["ENVELOPE"]
  #     puts "#{envelope.from[0].name}: \t#{envelope.subject}"
  #   end
  #
  # ==== Move all messages from April 2003 from "Mail/sent-mail" to "Mail/sent-apr03"
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
  #   imap.authenticate('PLAIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
  #   imap.select('Mail/sent-mail')
  #   if not imap.list('Mail/', 'sent-apr03')
  #     imap.create('Mail/sent-apr03')
  #   end
  #   imap.search(["BEFORE", "30-Apr-2003", "SINCE", "1-Apr-2003"]).each do |message_id|
  #     imap.copy(message_id, "Mail/sent-apr03")
  #     imap.store(message_id, "+FLAGS", [:Deleted])
  #   end
  #   imap.expunge
  #
  # == Capabilities
  #
  # Most Net::IMAP methods do not _currently_ modify their behaviour according
  # to the server's advertised #capabilities.  Users of this class must check
  # that the server is capable of extension commands or command arguments before
  # sending them.  Special care should be taken to follow the #capabilities
  # requirements for #starttls, #login, and #authenticate.
  #
  # See #capable?, #auth_capable?, #capabilities, #auth_mechanisms to discover
  # server capabilities.  For relevant capability requirements, see the
  # documentation on each \IMAP command.
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new("mail.example.com")
  #   imap.capable?(:IMAP4rev1) or raise "Not an IMAP4rev1 server"
  #   imap.capable?(:starttls)  or raise "Cannot start TLS"
  #   imap.starttls
  #
  #   if imap.auth_capable?("PLAIN")
  #     imap.authenticate "PLAIN", username, password
  #   elsif !imap.capability?("LOGINDISABLED")
  #     imap.login username, password
  #   else
  #     raise "No acceptable authentication mechanisms"
  #   end
  #
  #   # Support for "UTF8=ACCEPT" implies support for "ENABLE"
  #   imap.enable :utf8 if imap.capable?("UTF8=ACCEPT")
  #
  #   namespaces  = imap.namespace if imap.capable?(:namespace)
  #   mbox_prefix = namespaces&.personal&.first&.prefix || ""
  #   mbox_delim  = namespaces&.personal&.first&.delim  || "/"
  #   mbox_path   = prefix + %w[path to my mailbox].join(delim)
  #   imap.create mbox_path
  #
  # === Basic IMAP4rev1 capabilities
  #
  # IMAP4rev1 servers must advertise +IMAP4rev1+ in their capabilities list.
  # IMAP4rev1 servers must _implement_ the +STARTTLS+, <tt>AUTH=PLAIN</tt>,
  # and +LOGINDISABLED+ capabilities.  See #starttls, #login, and #authenticate
  # for the implications of these capabilities.
  #
  # === Caching +CAPABILITY+ responses
  #
  # Net::IMAP automatically stores and discards capability data according to the
  # the requirements and recommendations in
  # {IMAP4rev2 ยง6.1.1}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-6.1.1],
  # {ยง6.2}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-6.2], and
  # {ยง7.1}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-7.1].
  # Use #capable?, #auth_capable?, or #capabilities to use this cache and avoid
  # sending the #capability command unnecessarily.
  #
  # The server may advertise its initial capabilities using the +CAPABILITY+
  # ResponseCode in a +PREAUTH+ or +OK+ #greeting.  When TLS has started
  # (#starttls) and after authentication (#login or #authenticate), the server's
  # capabilities may change and cached capabilities are discarded.  The server
  # may send updated capabilities with an +OK+ TaggedResponse to #login or
  # #authenticate, and these will be cached by Net::IMAP.  But the
  # TaggedResponse to #starttls MUST be ignored--it is sent before TLS starts
  # and is unprotected.
  #
  # When storing capability values to variables, be careful that they are
  # discarded or reset appropriately, especially following #starttls.
  #
  # === Using IMAP4rev1 extensions
  #
  # See the {IANA IMAP4 capabilities
  # registry}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities] for a list of
  # all standard capabilities, and their reference RFCs.
  #
  # IMAP4rev1 servers must not activate behavior that is incompatible with the
  # base specification until an explicit client action invokes a capability,
  # e.g. sending a command or command argument specific to that capability.
  # Servers may send data with backward compatible behavior, such as response
  # codes or mailbox attributes, at any time without client action.
  #
  # Invoking capabilities which are unknown to Net::IMAP may cause unexpected
  # behavior and errors.  For example, ResponseParseError is raised when
  # unknown response syntax is received.  Invoking commands or command
  # parameters that are unsupported by the server may raise NoResponseError,
  # BadResponseError, or cause other unexpected behavior.
  #
  # Some capabilities must be explicitly activated using the #enable command.
  # See #enable for details.
  #
  # == Thread Safety
  #
  # Net::IMAP supports concurrent threads. For example,
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new("imap.foo.net", "imap2")
  #   imap.authenticate("scram-md5", "bar", "password")
  #   imap.select("inbox")
  #   fetch_thread = Thread.start { imap.fetch(1..-1, "UID") }
  #   search_result = imap.search(["BODY", "hello"])
  #   fetch_result = fetch_thread.value
  #   imap.disconnect
  #
  # This script invokes the FETCH command and the SEARCH command concurrently.
  #
  # When running multiple commands, care must be taken to avoid ambiguity.  For
  # example, SEARCH responses are ambiguous about which command they are
  # responding to, so search commands should not run simultaneously, unless the
  # server supports +ESEARCH+ {[RFC4731]}[https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4731] or
  # IMAP4rev2[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051].  See {RFC9051
  # ยง5.5}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051.html#section-5.5] for
  # other examples of command sequences which should not be pipelined.
  #
  # == Unbounded memory use
  #
  # Net::IMAP reads server responses in a separate receiver thread per client.
  # Unhandled response data is saved to #responses, and response_handlers run
  # inside the receiver thread.  See the list of methods for {handling server
  # responses}[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP@Handling+server+responses], below.
  #
  # Because the receiver thread continuously reads and saves new responses, some
  # scenarios must be careful to avoid unbounded memory use:
  #
  # * Commands such as #list or #fetch can have an enormous number of responses.
  # * Commands such as #fetch can result in an enormous size per response.
  # * Long-lived connections will gradually accumulate unsolicited server
  #   responses, especially +EXISTS+, +FETCH+, and +EXPUNGE+ responses.
  # * A buggy or untrusted server could send inappropriate responses, which
  #   could be very numerous, very large, and very rapid.
  #
  # Use paginated or limited versions of commands whenever possible.
  #
  # Use Config#max_response_size to impose a limit on incoming server responses
  # as they are being read.  <em>This is especially important for untrusted
  # servers.</em>
  #
  # Use #add_response_handler to handle responses after each one is received.
  # Use the +response_handlers+ argument to ::new to assign response handlers
  # before the receiver thread is started.  Use #extract_responses,
  # #clear_responses, or #responses (with a block) to prune responses.
  #
  # == Errors
  #
  # An \IMAP server can send three different types of responses to indicate
  # failure:
  #
  # NO:: the attempted command could not be successfully completed.  For
  #      instance, the username/password used for logging in are incorrect;
  #      the selected mailbox does not exist; etc.
  #
  # BAD:: the request from the client does not follow the server's
  #       understanding of the \IMAP protocol.  This includes attempting
  #       commands from the wrong client state; for instance, attempting
  #       to perform a SEARCH command without having SELECTed a current
  #       mailbox.  It can also signal an internal server
  #       failure (such as a disk crash) has occurred.
  #
  # BYE:: the server is saying goodbye.  This can be part of a normal
  #       logout sequence, and can be used as part of a login sequence
  #       to indicate that the server is (for some reason) unwilling
  #       to accept your connection.  As a response to any other command,
  #       it indicates either that the server is shutting down, or that
  #       the server is timing out the client connection due to inactivity.
  #
  # These three error response are represented by the errors
  # Net::IMAP::NoResponseError, Net::IMAP::BadResponseError, and
  # Net::IMAP::ByeResponseError, all of which are subclasses of
  # Net::IMAP::ResponseError.  Essentially, all methods that involve
  # sending a request to the server can generate one of these errors.
  # Only the most pertinent instances have been documented below.
  #
  # Because the IMAP class uses Sockets for communication, its methods
  # are also susceptible to the various errors that can occur when
  # working with sockets.  These are generally represented as
  # Errno errors.  For instance, any method that involves sending a
  # request to the server and/or receiving a response from it could
  # raise an Errno::EPIPE error if the network connection unexpectedly
  # goes down.  See the socket(7), ip(7), tcp(7), socket(2), connect(2),
  # and associated man pages.
  #
  # Finally, a Net::IMAP::DataFormatError is thrown if low-level data
  # is found to be in an incorrect format (for instance, when converting
  # between UTF-8 and UTF-16), and Net::IMAP::ResponseParseError is
  # thrown if a server response is non-parseable.

  #   Can be replaced with #noop or #idle.
  #
  # ==== Logout state
  #
  # No \IMAP commands are valid in the +logout+ state.  If the socket is still
  # open, Net::IMAP will close it after receiving server confirmation.
  # Exceptions will be raised by \IMAP commands that have already started and
  # are waiting for a response, as well as any that are called after logout.

    # ==== Options
    #
    # Accepts the following options:
    #
    # [port]
    #   Port number.  Defaults to 993 when +ssl+ is truthy, and 143 otherwise.
    #
    # [ssl]
    #   If +true+, the connection will use TLS with the default params set by
    #   {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#set_params}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-set_params].
    #   If +ssl+ is a hash, it's passed to
    #   {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#set_params}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-set_params];
    #   the keys are names of attribute assignment methods on
    #   SSLContext[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html].  For example:
    #
    #   [{ca_file}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#attribute-i-ca_file]]
    #     The path to a file containing a PEM-format CA certificate.
    #   [{ca_path}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#attribute-i-ca_path]]
    #     The path to a directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.
    #   [{min_version}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-min_version-3D]]
    #     Sets the lower bound on the supported SSL/TLS protocol version. Set to
    #     an +OpenSSL+ constant such as +OpenSSL::SSL::TLS1_2_VERSION+,
    #   [{verify_mode}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#attribute-i-verify_mode]]
    #     SSL session verification mode.  Valid modes include
    #     +OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER+ and +OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE+.
    #
    #   See {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html] for other valid SSL context params.
    #
    #   See DeprecatedClientOptions.new for deprecated SSL arguments.
    #
    # [response_handlers]
    #   A list of response handlers to be added before the receiver thread is
    #   started.  This ensures every server response is handled, including the
    #   #greeting.  Note that the greeting is handled in the current thread, but
    #   all other responses are handled in the receiver thread.
    #
    # [config]
    #   A Net::IMAP::Config object to use as the basis for #config.  By default,
    #   the global Net::IMAP.config is used.
    #
    #   >>>
    #     *NOTE:* +config+ does not set #config directly---it sets the _parent_
    #     config for inheritance.  Every client creates its own unique #config.
    #
    #   All other keyword arguments are forwarded to Net::IMAP::Config.new, to
    #   initialize the client's #config. For example:
    #
    #   [{open_timeout}[rdoc-ref:Config#open_timeout]]
    #     Seconds to wait until a connection is opened
    #   [{idle_response_timeout}[rdoc-ref:Config#idle_response_timeout]]
    #     Seconds to wait until an IDLE response is received
    #
    #   See Net::IMAP::Config for other valid options.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    # Connect to cleartext port 143 at mail.example.com and receive the server greeting:
    #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: false) # => #<Net::IMAP:0x00007f79b0872bd0>
    #   imap.port          => 143
    #   imap.tls_verified? => false
    #   imap.greeting      => name: ("OK" | "PREAUTH") => status
    #   status # => "OK"
    #   # The client is connected in the "Not Authenticated" state.
    #
    # Connect with TLS to port 993
    #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: true) # => #<Net::IMAP:0x00007f79b0872bd0>
    #   imap.port          => 993
    #   imap.tls_verified? => true
    #   imap.greeting      => name: (/OK/i | /PREAUTH/i) => status
    #   case status
    #   in /OK/i
    #     # The client is connected in the "Not Authenticated" state.
    #     imap.authenticate("PLAIN", "joe_user", "joes_password")
    #   in /PREAUTH/i
    #     # The client is connected in the "Authenticated" state.
    #   end
    #
    # Connect with prior authentication, for example using an SSL certificate:
    #   ssl_ctx_params = {
    #     cert: OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read("client.crt")),
    #     key:  OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new(File.read('client.key')),
    #     extra_chain_cert: [
    #       OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read("intermediate.crt")),
    #     ],
    #   }
    #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: ssl_ctx_params)
    #   imap.port          => 993
    #   imap.tls_verified? => true
    #   imap.greeting      => name: "PREAUTH"
    #   # The client is connected in the "Authenticated" state.
    #
    # ==== Exceptions
    #
    # The most common errors are:
    #
    # [Errno::ECONNREFUSED]
    #   Connection refused by +host+ or an intervening firewall.
    # [Errno::ETIMEDOUT]
    #   Connection timed out (possibly due to packets being dropped by an
    #   intervening firewall).

    #   There is no route to that network.
    # [SocketError]
    #   Hostname not known or other socket error.

    #
    # ==== Mechanisms
    #
    # Each mechanism has different properties and requirements.  Please consult
    # the documentation for the specific mechanisms you are using:
    #
    # +ANONYMOUS+::
    #     See AnonymousAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::AnonymousAuthenticator].
    #
    #     Allows the user to gain access to public services or resources without
    #     authenticating or disclosing an identity.
    #
    # +EXTERNAL+::
    #     See ExternalAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::ExternalAuthenticator].
    #
    #     Authenticates using already established credentials, such as a TLS
    #     certificate or IPsec.
    #
    # +OAUTHBEARER+::
    #     See OAuthBearerAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::OAuthBearerAuthenticator].
    #
    #     Login using an OAuth2 Bearer token.  This is the standard mechanism
    #     for using OAuth2 with \SASL, but it is not yet deployed as widely as
    #     +XOAUTH2+.
    #
    # +PLAIN+::
    #     See PlainAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::PlainAuthenticator].
    #
    #     Login using clear-text username and password.
    #
    # +SCRAM-SHA-1+::
    # +SCRAM-SHA-256+::
    #     See ScramAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::ScramAuthenticator].
    #
    #     Login by username and password.  The password is not sent to the
    #     server but is used in a salted challenge/response exchange.
    #     +SCRAM-SHA-1+ and +SCRAM-SHA-256+ are directly supported by
    #     Net::IMAP::SASL.  New authenticators can easily be added for any other
    #     <tt>SCRAM-*</tt> mechanism if the digest algorithm is supported by
    #     OpenSSL::Digest.
    #
    # +XOAUTH2+::
    #     See XOAuth2Authenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::XOAuth2Authenticator].
    #
    #     Login using a username and an OAuth2 access token.  Non-standard and
    #     obsoleted by +OAUTHBEARER+, but widely supported.
    #
    # See the {SASL mechanism
    # registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml]
    # for a list of all SASL mechanisms and their specifications.  To register
    # new authenticators, see Authenticators.
    #
    # ===== Deprecated mechanisms
    #
    # <em>Obsolete mechanisms should be avoided, but are still available for
    # backwards compatibility.  See</em> Net::IMAP::SASL@Deprecated+mechanisms.
    # <em>Using a deprecated mechanism will print a warning.</em>
    #
    # ==== Capabilities
    #
    # <tt>"AUTH=#{mechanism}"</tt> capabilities indicate server support for
    # mechanisms.  Use #auth_capable? or #auth_mechanisms to check for support
    # before using a particular mechanism.
    #
    #    if imap.auth_capable? "XOAUTH2"
    #      imap.authenticate "XOAUTH2", username, oauth2_access_token
    #    elsif imap.auth_capable? "PLAIN"

    #      imap.login username, password
    #    else
    #      raise "No acceptable authentication mechanism is available"
    #    end
    #
    # Although servers should list all supported \SASL mechanisms, they may
    # allow authentication with an unlisted +mechanism+.
    #
    # If [SASL-IR[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4959.html]] is supported
    # and the appropriate <tt>"AUTH=#{mechanism}"</tt> capability is present,
    # an "initial response" may be sent as an argument to the +AUTHENTICATE+
    # command, saving a round-trip.  The SASL exchange allows for server
    # challenges and client responses, but many mechanisms expect the client to
    # "respond" first.  The initial response will only be sent for
    # "client-first" mechanisms.
    #
    # Server capabilities may change after #starttls, #login, and #authenticate.
    # Previously cached #capabilities will be cleared when this method
    # completes.  If the TaggedResponse to #authenticate includes updated
    # capabilities, they will be cached.

    # LoginDisabledError when that capability is present.  See

    # with "+.+" as the hierarchy delimiter. If the client does not check for
    # this, but naively assumes it can use the same folder names for all

    #    a certain mailbox, there can be circumstances where it is unclear which
    #    Personal Namespaces it should create the mailbox in.  In these

    #   +Range+ elements which begin and end with negative integers are encoded
    #   for use with +PARTIAL+--any other ranges are converted to SequenceSet.
    #   Unlike +criteria+, other return option arguments are not automatically
    #   converted to SequenceSet.
    #
    # [When +criteria+ is an Array]
    #   When the array begins with <tt>"RETURN"</tt> (case insensitive), the
    #   second array element is translated like the +return+ parameter (as
    #   described above).
    #
    #   Every other member is a +SEARCH+ command argument:
    #   [SequenceSet]
    #     Encoded as an \IMAP +sequence-set+ with SequenceSet#valid_string.
    #   [Set, Range, <tt>-1</tt>, +:*+, responds to +#to_sequence_set+]
    #     Converted to SequenceSet for validation and encoding.
    #   [nested sequence-set +Array+]
    #     When every element in a nested array is one of the above types, a
    #     positive +Integer+, a sequence-set formatted +String+, or a deeply
    #     nested +Array+ of these same types, the array will be converted to
    #     SequenceSet for validation and encoding.
    #   [Any other nested +Array+]
    #     Otherwise, a nested array is encoded as a parenthesized list, to
    #     combine multiple search keys (e.g., for use with +OR+ and +NOT+).
    #   [+String+]
    #     Sent verbatim when it is a valid \IMAP +atom+, and encoded as an \IMAP
    #     +quoted+ or +literal+ string otherwise.  Every standard search key
    #     name is a valid \IMAP +atom+ and every standard search key string
    #     argument is an +astring+ which may be encoded as +atom+, +quoted+, or
    #     +literal+.
    #
    #     *Note:* <tt>*</tt> is not a valid \IMAP +atom+ character.  Any string
    #     containing <tt>*</tt> will be encoded as a +quoted+ string, _not_ a
    #     +sequence-set+.
    #   [+Integer+ (except for <tt>-1</tt>)]
    #     Encoded using +#to_s+.
    #   [+Date+]
    #     Encoded as an \IMAP date (see ::encode_date).
    #
    # [When +criteria+ is a String]
    #   +criteria+ will be sent directly to the server <em>without any

    # The following capabilities may be enabled:
    #
    # [+CONDSTORE+ {[RFC7162]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7162.html]]
    #
    #   Updates various commands to return +CONDSTORE+ extension responses.  It
    #   is not necessary to explicitly enable +CONDSTORE+โusing any of the
    #   command parameters defined by the extension will implicitly enable it.
    #   See {[RFC7162 ยง3.1]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7162.html#section-3.1].
    #
    # [+:utf8+ --- an alias for <tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt>]
    #
    #   In a future release, <tt>enable(:utf8)</tt> will enable either
    #   <tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt> or <tt>"IMAP4rev2"</tt>, depending on server
    #   capabilities.

    #   <tt>UTF8=ONLY</tt>.
    #
    #   This allows the server to send strings encoded as UTF-8 which might
    #   otherwise need to use a 7-bit encoding, such as {modified
    #   UTF-7}[::decode_utf7] for mailbox names, or RFC2047 encoded-words for
    #   message headers.
    #
    #   *Note:* <em>A future update may set string encodings slightly
    #   differently</em>, e.g: "US-ASCII" when UTF-8 is not enabled, and "UTF-8"
    #   when it is.  Currently, the encoding of strings sent as "quoted" or
    #   "text" will _always_ be "UTF-8", even when only ASCII characters are
    #   used (e.g. "Subject: Agenda") And currently, string "literals" sent
    #   by the server will always have an "ASCII-8BIT" (binary)
    #   encoding, even if they generally contain UTF-8 data, if they are
    #   text at all.
    #
    # [<tt>"UTF8=ONLY"</tt> [RFC6855[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6855]]]
    #
    #   A server that reports the <tt>UTF8=ONLY</tt> capability _requires_ that
    #   the client <tt>enable("UTF8=ACCEPT")</tt> before any mailboxes may be
    #   selected.  For convenience, <tt>enable("UTF8=ONLY")</tt> is aliased to
    #   <tt>enable("UTF8=ACCEPT")</tt>.

    #
    #   When UIDONLY is enabled, the #fetch, #store, #search, #copy, and #move
    #   commands are prohibited and result in a tagged BAD response. Clients
    #   should instead use uid_fetch, uid_store, uid_search, uid_copy, or
    #   uid_move, respectively. All +FETCH+ responses that would be returned are
    #   replaced by +UIDFETCH+ responses. All +EXPUNGED+ responses that would be
    #   returned are replaced by +VANISHED+ responses. The "<sequence set>"
    #   uid_search criterion is prohibited.
    #
    # ===== Unsupported capabilities
    #
    # *Note:* Some extensions that use ENABLE permit the server to send syntax
    # that Net::IMAP cannot parse, which may raise an exception and disconnect.
    # Some extensions may work, but the support may be incomplete, untested, or
    # experimental.
    #
    # Until a capability is documented here as supported, enabling it may result
    # in undocumented behavior and a future release may update with incompatible

    # ==== Thread safety
    # >>>
    #   *Note:* Access to the responses hash is synchronized for thread-safety.
    #   The receiver thread and response_handlers cannot process new responses
    #   until the block completes.  Accessing either the response hash or its
    #   response type arrays outside of the block is unsafe.  They can be safely
    #   updated inside the block.  Consider using #clear_responses or
    #   #extract_responses instead.
    #
    #   Net::IMAP will add and remove responses from the responses hash and its
    #   array values, in the calling threads for commands and in the receiver
    #   thread, but will not modify any responses after adding them to the
    #   responses hash.
    #
    # ==== Clearing responses
    #
    # Previously unhandled responses are automatically cleared before entering a
    # mailbox with #select or #examine.  Long-lived connections can receive many
    # unhandled server responses, which must be pruned or they will continually
    # consume more memory.  Update or clear the responses hash or arrays inside
    # the block, or remove responses with #extract_responses, #clear_responses,
    # or #add_response_handler.
    #
    # ==== Missing responses
    #
    # Only non-+nil+ data is stored.  Many important response codes have no data
    # of their own, but are used as "tags" on the ResponseText object they are
    # attached to.  ResponseText will be accessible by its response types:
    # "+OK+", "+NO+", "+BAD+", "+BYE+", or "+PREAUTH+".
    #
    # TaggedResponse#data is not saved to #responses, nor is any
    # ResponseCode#data on tagged responses.  Although some command methods do
    # return the TaggedResponse directly, #add_response_handler must be used to
