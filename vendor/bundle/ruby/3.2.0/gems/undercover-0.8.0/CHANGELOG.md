# [0.8.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added
- Filter out files ignored by simplecov using `add_filter` ([#234](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/pull/234))
- Add LF and LH parsing to LcovParser for simplecov-lcov 0.9 compatibility

### Fixed
- Fix an `Undercover::Result` edge case causing errors with ignored branches on uningnored lines

# [0.7.4] - 2025-07-13

### Fixed
- Fix `fnmatch` for `FilterSet` to support glob braces (sets) in `--include-files` and `--exclude-files`

# [0.7.3] - 2025-07-13

### Fixed
- Improve Options#parse with glob braces support, strip quotes properly from .undercover config files
- Fix Result#coverage_f to support ignored branches
- Fix error parsing JSON coverage with branch coverage disabled ([#231](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/issues/231))
- Fixed NoMethodError and Errno::ENOENT that were occurring when coverage report doesn't exist ([#232](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/issues/232))

# [0.7.2] - 2025-07-07

### Fixed
- Resolved errors when .lcov files doesn't exist using `--lcov` CLI flag and `guess_lcov_path`

# [0.7.0] - 2025-07-03

### Added
- New native SimpleCov formatter that generates coverage data directly without requiring LCOV conversion ([#223](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/pull/223))
- `--simplecov -s` CLI option to specify coverage JSON file path as an alternative to LCOV and future default ([#223](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/pull/223))
- Improved path handling for projects running in nested subdirectories or monorepo setups ([#223](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/pull/223))

### Fixed
- `:nocov:` support to skip coverage analysis for specific code blocks works again after a regression in `0.6+` ([#223](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/pull/223))

# [0.6.6] - 2025-07-01

- Bugfix in `max_warnings_limit` following ([#229](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/pull/229))

# [0.6.5] - 2025-07-01

### Fixed
- Improved performance for large PRs with lazy diff enumeration ([#229](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/pull/229))

# [0.6.4] - 2025-03-29

### Fixed
- Fix more false positives due to source file / coverage locator issues ([#222](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/issues/222))

# [0.6.3] - 2024-12-23

### Fixed
- Fix false positives with empty blocks/methods on a single line ([#216](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/issues/216)) by [@splattael](https://github.com/splattael).
- Updated list of default excluded directories (added `db/` and `config/`)

# [0.6.0] - 2024-12-12
### Added
- Add support for including and exluding files by glob patterns, supplied through CLI args and the configuration file (#146)

### Fixed
- Files that were changed but don't appear in the coverage report at all will now be reported as uncovered, as expected.
- Fixed an issue where top-level methods were not being considered [#135](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/issues/135). This was caused by a bug in the tree traversal logic.
- Fixed a bug where `--compare` didn't work with grafted commits as there was no merge base available ([#175](https://github.com/grodowski/undercover/issues/175)). Now it's possible to pass a graft commit as `--compare` which enables `undercover` to work with shallow clones.
