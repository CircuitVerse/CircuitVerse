# MIME Types Changes by Version

<!-- automatic-release -->

## 3.2025.0826 / 2025-08-26

- Updated registry entries from the IANA [media registry][registry] and
  [provisional media registry][provisional], the [Apache httpd media registry][httpd],
  and the [Apache Tika media registry][tika] as of the release date.


## 3.2025.0819 / 2025-08-19

- Updated registry entries from the IANA [media registry][registry] and
  [provisional media registry][provisional], the [Apache httpd media registry][httpd],
  and the [Apache Tika media registry][tika] as of the release date.


## 3.2025.0812 / 2025-08-12

- Updated registry entries from the IANA [media registry][registry] and
  [provisional media registry][provisional], the [Apache httpd media registry][httpd],
  and the [Apache Tika media registry][tika] as of the release date.


## 3.2025.0805 / 2025-08-05

- Updated registry entries from the IANA [media registry][registry] and
  [provisional media registry][provisional], the [Apache httpd media registry][httpd],
  and the [Apache Tika media registry][tika] as of the release date.


## 3.2025.0729 / 2025-07-29

- Updated registry entries from the IANA [media registry][registry] and
  [provisional media registry][provisional], the [Apache httpd media registry][httpd],
  and the [Apache Tika media registry][tika] as of the release date.



- Remove `.doc` from `text/plain`: The use of `.doc` for `text/plain` documents
  is mostly a holdover from VAX VMS where the default wasn't `.txt` but `.doc`.
  The world now thinks that `.doc` mostly means `application/msword` even though
  that format is obsolete by almost twenty years. Closes
  [ruby-mime-types#224][ruby-mime-types#224] with [#191][pull-191].

- Handle promoted and withdrawn provisional IANA media types. Closes
  [#54][issue-54] with [#192][pull-192].

  The logic is three relatively simple phases:

  1. When loading an existing registry grouping (such as
     `types/application.yaml`), we mark any type that is `provisional` as
     `obsolete`. This indicates that we consider any provisional type as
     potentially withdrawn (and therefore obsolete).
  2. When processing existing regular types, we clear both `provisional` and
     `obsolete` flags so that a type promoted from provisional is now a regular
     registry entry.
  3. After merging the current list of registry entries, we _clear_
     `provisional` if the type is marked both `provisional` and `obsolete`,
     indicating that the provisional type has been withdrawn.

  These heuristics match several types which have been promoted and withdrawn
  since the handling of provisional types was improved with [#53][pull-53].

## 3.2025.0527 / 2025-05-27

- Updated registry entries from the IANA [media registry][registry] and

  [Apache Tika media registry][tika] as of the release date.

## 3.2025.0520 / 2025-05-20

  [provisional media registry][provisional], the

## 3.2025.0514 / 2025-05-14

- Updated registry entries from the IANA [media registry][registry] and

  [Apache httpd media registry][httpd], and the
  [Apache Tika media registry][tika] as of the release date.

## 3.2025.0507 / 2025-05-07

- Added new data for pre-computed priority sorting. This new data requires Ruby
  mime-types 3.7.0 or later to manage data but is ignored by older versions of
  mime-types.

- Added a parser for the [Apache Tika media registry][tika] to enrich the media
  definitions, mostly by adding new patterns for media type extensions. This
  parser:

  1. Parses the current `tika-mimetypes.xml` from the main branch of
     [Tika][tika] on GitHub.

  2. Skips over any `mime-type` record that has attributes. That is, any record
     which looks like `media/subtype;format=foo` or `media/subtype;version=2`
     will be skipped. Support for attributes does not currently exist in the
     mime-types library.

  3. Extracts the `glob` entries for use in the `extensions` field. Globs that
     use `*` in the middle of a filename are excluded, because that's now how
     the Ruby MIME::Types field works (I could add a new `glob` field, but that
     will take a bit more work).

  4. Updates the `extensions` field for any existing MIME::Type or creates new
     unregistered (not defined in IANA) types for new ones.

- Updated the history body to reflect the new data source for updates.

- Some details were removed from older CHANGELOG entries relating to updated
  MIME types from more or less automated processes.

## 3.2025.0506 / 2025-05-06

  `vendor/` was no longer ignored.

- Fixed the automated release builder process to handle the case when the
  `automatic-release` tag is followed by a `## NEXT / YYYY-MM-DD` header so that
  changes merged normally are picked up on automatic releases. [#98][pull-98]

## 3.2025.0107 / 2025-01-07

  [provisional media registry][provisional] and the

## 3.2023.0218.1 / 2023-02-18

- When this data library was created in 2015, I made the decision based on
  information available to deprecate `text/javascript` in favour of
  `application/javascript`. Since the previous update (2022-01-05), IANA has
  officially deprecated `application/javascript` in favour of `text/javascript`.
  Samuel Williams discovered this in [#55][issue-55] by noting that all `js`
  types were marked obsolete in version 3.2023.0218.

  A hot fix has been applied to resolve this. However, note that
  `application/javascript` will not be returned by default, only
  `text/javascript`.

## 3.2023.0218 / 2023-02-18

- Updated registry entries from the IANA [media registry][registry] and
  [provisional media registry][provisional] and the
  [Apache httpd media registry][httpd] as of the release date.

- Mohammed Gad added the `jfif` file extension for `image/jpeg` text format.
  [#52][pull-52]

- Reworked the loading of IANA provisional media registries to merge them into
  the top-level media-type registries instead of a standalone registry file.
  [#53][pull-53] originally identified by Chris Salzberg in [#50][pull-50].

  It is worth noting that this is an _imperfect_ solution as if a media type is
  provisionally registered and withdrawn, it will linger in the registry with no
  clean way of identifying them at the moment. See [#54][issue-54].

  This release also fixes [ruby-mime-types#163][ruby-mime-types#163], where logs
  show "Type `application/netcdf` is already registered as a variant of
  `application/netcdf`".

## 3.2022.0105 / 2022-01-05

- Updated registry entries from the IANA [media registry][registry] and
  [provisional media registry][provisional] and the
  [Apache httpd media registry][httpd] as of the release date.

  and later registered. Fixed [#48][issue-48], found by William T. Nelson.

## 3.2021.1115 / 2021-11-15

- Updated registry entries from the IANA [media registry][registry] and
  [provisional media registry][provisional] and the

  have been ported from the [mini\_mime][mini_mime] repository. [#47][pull-47]

- Added IANA provisional media registries. Added some notes to CONTRIBUTING
  about the transient nature of the provisional registration data. This was
  triggered in part by a pull request by Jon Sneyers. Thanks! [#45][pull-45],
  [#43][pull-43]

## 3.2021.0901 / 2021-09-01

  the changes to git.

## 3.2020.1104 / 2020-11-04

- Updated the IANA media registry entries as of release date.

## 2.1 / 2014-01-25

- The IANA media type registry format changed, resulting in updates to most of
  the 1,427 registered MIME types.
  - Many registered MIME types have had some metadata updates due to the change
    in the IANA registry format.
    - MIME types having a publicly available registry application now include a
      link to that file in references.
  - Added `xrefs` data as discovered (see the API changes noted above).

- The Apache httpd mime types configuration has been added to track additional
  common but unregistered MIME types and known extensions for those MIME types.
  This has affected many of the available MIME types.

- Merged the non-standard VMS platform `text/plain` with the standard
  `text/plain`.
