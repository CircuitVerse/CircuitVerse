# Changelog

## 3.7.0 / 2025-05-07

- Deprecated `MIME::Type#priority_compare`. In a future release, this will be
  will be renamed to `MIME::Type#<=>`. This method is used in tight loops, so
  there is no warning message for either `MIME::Type#priority_compare` or
  `MIME::Type#<=>`.

- Improved the performance of sorting by eliminating the complex comparison flow
  from `MIME::Type#priority_compare`. The old version shows under 600 i/s, and
  the new version shows over 900 i/s. In sorting the full set of MIME data,
  there are three differences between the old and new versions; after
  comparison, these differences are considered acceptable.

- Simplified the default compare implementation (`MIME::Type#<=>`) to use the
  new `MIME::Type#priority_compare` operation and simplify the fallback to
  `String` comparison. This _may_ result in exceptions where there had been
  none, as explicit support for several special values (which should have caused
  errors in any case) have been removed.

- When sorting the result of `MIME::Types#type_for`, provided a priority boost
  if one of the target extensions is the type's preferred extension. This means
  that for the case in [#148][issue-148], when getting the type for `foo.webm`,
  the type `video/webm` will be returned before the type `audio/webm`, because
  `.webm` is the preferred extension for `video/webm` but not `audio/webm`
  (which has a preferred extension of `.weba`). Added tests to ensure MIME types
  are retrieved in a stable order (which is alphabetical).

## 3.6.2 / 2025-03-25

- Updated the reference to the changelog in the README, fixing RubyGems metadata
  on the next release. Fixed in [#189][pull-189] by nna774.

- Daniel Watkins fixed an error in the repo tag for this release because the
  modified gemspec was not included in the release. Fixed in [#196][pull-196].

## 3.6.1 / 2025-03-15

- Restructure project structure to be more consistent with mime-types-data.

- Increased GitHub action security. Added Ruby 3.4, dropped macOS 12, added
  macOS 15.

- Added [trusted publishing][tp] for fully automated releases.

- Added `MIME::Types::NullLogger` to completely silence MIME::Types logging.

- Improved the development experience with updates to the Gemfile.

- Worked around various issues with the benchmarks and profiling code.

- Removed Forwardable from MIME::Types::Container.

- Added coverage support (back).

## 3.6.0 / 2024-10-02

- 2 deprecations:

  - Array-based MIME::Type initialization
  - String-based MIME::Type initialization

  Use of these these will result in deprecation warnings.

- Added `logger` to the gemspec to suppress a bundled gem warning with Ruby
  3.3.5. This warning should not be showing up until Ruby 3.4.0 is released and
  will be suppressed in Ruby 3.3.6.

- Reworked the deprecation message code to be somewhat more flexible and allow
  for outputting certain warnings once. Because there will be at least one other
  release after 3.6, we do not need to make the type initialization deprecations
  frequent with this release.

## 3.5.2 / 2024-01-02

There are no primary code changes, but we are releasing this as an update as
there are some validation changes and updated code with formatting.

- Dependency and CI updates:

  - Masato Nakamura added Ruby 3.3 to the CI workflow in [#179][pull-179].

  - Fixed regressions in standard formatting in [#180][pull-180].

  - Removed `minitest-bonus-assertions` because of a bundler resolution issue.
    Created a better replacement in-line.

## 3.5.1 / 2023-08-21

- 1 bug fix:

  - Better handle possible line-termination strings (legal in Unix filenames)
    such as `\n` in `MIME::Types.type_for`. Reported by ooooooo-q in
    [#177][issue-177], resolved in [#178][pull-178].

## 3.5.0 / 2023-08-07

- 1 minor enhancement:

  - Robb Shecter changed the default log level for duplicate type variant from
    `warn` to `debug` in [#170][pull-170]. This works because
    `MIME::Types.logger` is intended to fit the `::Logger` interface, and the
    default logger (`WarnLogger`) is a subclass of `::Logger` that passes
    through to `Kernel.warn`.

    - Further consideration has changed cache load messages from `warn` to
      `error` and deprecation messages from `warn` to `debug`.

- 1 bug fix:

  - Added a definition of `MIME::Type#hash`. Contributed by Alex Vondrak in
    [#167][pull-167], fixing [#166][issue-166].

- Dependency and CI updates:

  - Update the .github/workflows/ci.yml workflow to test Ruby 3.2 and more
    reliably test certain combinations rather than depending on exclusions.

  - Change `.standard.yml` configuration to format for Ruby 2.3 as certain files
    are not properly detected with Ruby 2.0.

    - Change from `hoe-git` to `hoe-git2` to support Hoe version 4.

    - Apply `standardrb --fix`.

    - The above changes have resulted in the Soft deprecation of Ruby versions
      below 2.6. Any errors reported for Ruby versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4,
      and 2.5 will be resolved, but maintaining CI for these versions is
      unsustainable.

## 3.4.1 / 2021-11-16

- 1 bug fix:

  - Fixed a Ruby &lt; 2.3 incompatibility introduced by the use of standardrb,
    where `<<-` heredocs were converted to `<<~` heredocs. These have been
    reverted back to `<<-` with the indentation kept and a `.strip` call to
    prevent excess whitespace.

## 3.4.0 / 2021-11-15

- 1 minor enhancement:

  - Added a new field to `MIME::Type` for checking provisional registrations
    from IANA. [#157]

- Documentation:

  - Kevin Menard synced the documentation so that all examples are correct.
    [#153]

- Administrivia:

  - Added Ruby 3.0 to the CI test matrix. Added `windows/jruby` to the CI
    exclusion list; it refuses to run successfully.
  - Removed the Travis CI configuration and changed it to Github Workflows
    [#150][pull-150]. Removed Coveralls configuration.
  - Igor Victor added TruffleRuby to the Travis CI configuration. [#149]
  - Koichi ITO loosened an excessively tight dependency. [#147]
  - Started using `standardrb` for Ruby formatting and validation.
  - Moved `deps:top` functionality to a support file.

## 3.3.1 / 2019-12-26

- 1 minor bug fix:

  - Al Snow fixed a warning with MIME::Types::Logger producing a warning because
    Ruby 2.7 introduces numbered block parameters. Because of the way that the
    MIME::Types::Logger works for deprecation messages, the initializer
    parameters had been named `_1`, `_2`, and `_3`. This has now been resolved.
    [#146]

- Administrivia:

  - Olle Jonsson removed an outdated Travis configuration option.
    [#142][pull-142]

## 3.3 / 2019-09-04

- 1 minor enhancement:

  - Jean Boussier reduced memory usage for Ruby versions 2.3 or higher by
    interning various string values in each type. This is done with a
    backwards-compatible call that _freezes_ the strings on older versions of
    Ruby. [#141]

- Administrivia:

  - Nicholas La Roux updated Travis build configurations. [#139]

## 3.2.2 / 2018-08-12

- Hiroto Fukui removed a stray `debugger` statement that I had used in producing
  v3.2.1. [#137]

## 3.2.1 / 2018-08-12

- A few bugs related to MIME::Types::Container and its use in the
  mime-types-data helper tools reared their head because I released 3.2 before
  verifying against mime-types-data.

## 3.2 / 2018-08-12

- 2 minor enhancements

  - Janko MarohniÄ‡ contributed a change to `MIME::Type#priority_order` that
    should improve on strict sorting when dealing with MIME types that appear to
    be in the same family even if strict sorting would cause an unregistered
    type to be sorted first. [#132]

  - Dillon Welch contributed a change that added `frozen_string_literal: true`
    to files so that modern Rubies can automatically reduce duplicate string
    allocations. [#135]

- 2 bug fixes

  - Burke Libbey fixed a problem with cached data loading. [#126]

  - Resolved an issue where Enumerable#inject returns `nil` when provided an
    empty enumerable and a default value has not been provided. This is because
    when Enumerable#inject isn't provided a starting value, the first value is
    used as the default value. In every case where this error was happening, the
    result was supposed to be an array containing Set objects so they can be
    reduced to a single Set. [#117][issue-117], [#127][issue-127],
    [#134][issue-134]

  - Fixed an uncontrolled growth bug in MIME::Types::Container where a key miss
    would create a new entry with an empty Set in the container. This was
    working as designed (this particular feature was heavily used during
    MIME::Type registry construction), but the design was flawed in that it did
    not have any way of determining the difference between construction and
    querying. This would mean that, if you have a function in your web app that
    queries the MIME::Types registry by extension, the extension registry would
    grow uncontrollably. [#136]

- Deprecations:

  - Lazy loading (`$RUBY_MIME_TYPES_LAZY_LOAD`) has been deprecated.

- Documentation Changes:

  - Supporting files are now Markdown instead of rdoc, except for the README.

  - The history file has been modified to remove all history prior to 3.0. This
    history can be found in previous commits.

  - A spelling error was corrected by Edward Betts ([#129][pull-129]).

- Administrivia:

  - CI configuration for more modern versions of Ruby were added by Nicolas
    Leger ([#130][pull-130]), Jun Aruga ([#125][pull-125]), and Austin Ziegler.
    Removed ruby-head-clang and rbx (Rubinius) from CI.

  - Fixed tests which were asserting equality against nil, which will become an
    error in Minitest 6.

## 3.1 / 2016-05-22

- 1 documentation change:

  - Tim Smith (@tas50) updated the build badges to be SVGs to improve
    readability on high-density (retina) screens with pull request
    [#112][pull-112].

- 3 bug fixes

  - A test for `MIME::Types::Cache` fails under Ruby 2.3 because of frozen
    strings, [#118][pull-118]. This has been fixed.

  - The JSON data has been incorrectly encoded since the release of mime-types 3
    on the `xrefs` field, because of the switch to using a Set to store
    cross-reference information. This has been fixed.

  - A tentative fix for [#117][issue-117] has been applied, removing the only
    circular require dependencies that exist (and for which there was code to
    prevent, but the current fix is simpler). I have no way to verify this fix
    and depending on how things are loaded by `delayed_job`, this fix may not be
    sufficient.

- 1 governance change

  - Updated to Contributor Covenant 1.4.

## 3.0 / 2015-11-21

- 2 governance changes

  - This project and the related mime-types-data project are now exclusively MIT
    licensed. Resolves [#95][pull-95].

  - All projects under the mime-types organization now have a standard code of
    conduct adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][contributor covenant]. This
    text can be found in the [Code of Conduct][code of conduct] file.

- 3 major changes

  - All methods deprecated in mime-types 2.x have been removed.

  - mime-types now requires Ruby 2.0 compatibility or later. Resolves
    [#97][pull-97].

  - The registry data has been removed from mime-types and put into
    mime-types-data, maintained and released separately. It can be found at
    [mime-types-data][mime-types-data].

- 17 minor changes:

  - `MIME::Type` changes:

    - Changed the way that simplified types representations are created to
      reflect the fact that `x-` prefixes are no longer considered special
      according to IANA. A simplified MIME type is case-folded to lowercase. A
      new keyword parameter, `remove_x_prefix`, can be provided to remove `x-`
      prefixes.

    - Improved initialization with an Array works so that extensions do not need
      to be wrapped in another array. This means that `%w(text/yaml yaml yml)`
      works in the same way that `['text/yaml', %w(yaml yml)]` did (and still
      does).

    - Changed `priority_compare` to conform with attributes that no longer
      exist.

    - Changed the internal implementation of extensions to use a frozen Set.

    - When extensions are set or modified with `add_extensions`, the primary
      registry will be informed of a need to re-index extensions. Resolves
      [#84][pull-84].

    - The preferred extension can be set explicitly. If not set, it will be the
      first extension. If the preferred extension is not in the extension list,
      it will be added.

    - Improved how xref URLs are generated.

    - Converted `obsolete`, `registered` and `signature` to `attr_accessors`.

  - `MIME::Types` changes:

    - Modified `MIME::Types.new` to track instances of `MIME::Types` so that
      they can be told to reindex the extensions as necessary.

    - Removed `data_version` attribute.

    - Changed `#[]` so that the `complete` and `registered` flags are keywords
      instead of a generic options parameter.

    - Extracted the class methods to a separate file.

    - Changed the container implementation to use a Set instead of an Array to
      prevent data duplication. Resolves [#79][pull-79].

  - `MIME::Types::Cache` changes:

    - Caching is now based on the data gem version instead of the mime-types
      version.

    - Caching is compatible with columnar registry stores.

  - `MIME::Types::Loader` changes:

    - `MIME::Types::Loader::PATH` has been removed and replaced with
      `MIME::Types::Data::PATH` from the mime-types-data gem. The environment
      variable `RUBY_MIME_TYPES_DATA` is still used.

    - Support for the long-deprecated mime-types v1 format has been removed.

    - The registry is default loaded from the columnar store by default. The
      internal format of the columnar store has changed; many of the boolean
      flags are now loaded from a single file. Resolves [#85][pull-85].
