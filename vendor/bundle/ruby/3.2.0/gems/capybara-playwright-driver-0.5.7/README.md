# ðŸŽ­ Playwright driver for Capybara

Make it easy to introduce Playwright into your Rails application.

```ruby
gem 'capybara-playwright-driver'
```

**NOTE**: If you want to use Playwright-native features (such as auto-waiting, various type of locators, ...), [consider using playwright-ruby-client directly](https://playwright-ruby-client.vercel.app/docs/article/guides/rails_integration_with_null_driver).

## Examples

```ruby
require 'capybara-playwright-driver'

# setup
Capybara.register_driver(:playwright) do |app|
  Capybara::Playwright::Driver.new(app, browser_type: :firefox, headless: false)
end
Capybara.default_max_wait_time = 15
Capybara.default_driver = :playwright
Capybara.save_path = 'tmp/capybara'

# run
Capybara.app_host = 'https://github.com'
visit '/'
first('div.search-input-container').click
fill_in('query-builder-test', with: 'Capybara')

## [REMARK] We can use Playwright-native selector and action, instead of Capybara DSL.
# first('[aria-label="Capybara, Search all of GitHub"]').click
page.driver.with_playwright_page do |page|
  page.get_by_label('Capybara, Search all of GitHub').click
end

all('[data-testid="results-list"] h3').each do |li|
  #puts "#{li.all('a').first.text} by Capybara"
  puts "#{li.with_playwright_element_handle { |handle| handle.text_content }} by Playwright"
end
```
