# OpenTelemetry Concurrent Ruby Instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry Concurrent Ruby gem is a community maintained instrumentation for the [Concurrent Ruby][concurrent-ruby-home]. This is a concurrency toolkit inspired from various languages and classic concurrency patterns.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```console
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-concurrent_ruby
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-concurrent_ruby` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To install the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::ConcurrentRuby'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

## How can I get involved?

The `opentelemetry-instrumentation-concurrent_ruby` gem source is [on github][repo-github], along with related gems including `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk`.

The OpenTelemetry Ruby gems are maintained by the OpenTelemetry Ruby special interest group (SIG). You can get involved by joining us on our [GitHub Discussions][discussions-url], [Slack Channel][slack-channel] or attending our weekly meeting. See the [meeting calendar][community-meetings] for dates and times. For more information on this and other language SIGs, see the OpenTelemetry [community page][ruby-sig].
