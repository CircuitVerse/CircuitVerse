# Keyboard


Keyboard provides an api for managing a virtual keyboard. The high level api is [Keyboard#type](./keyboard#type), which takes
raw characters and generates proper `keydown`, `keypress`/`input`, and `keyup` events on your page.

For finer control, you can use [Keyboard#down](./keyboard#down), [Keyboard#up](./keyboard#up), and [Keyboard#insert_text](./keyboard#insert_text)
to manually fire events as if they were generated from a real keyboard.

An example of holding down `Shift` in order to select and delete some text:

```ruby
page.keyboard.type("Hello World!")
page.keyboard.press("ArrowLeft")
page.keyboard.down("Shift")
6.times { page.keyboard.press("ArrowLeft") }
page.keyboard.up("Shift")
page.keyboard.press("Backspace")
# result text will end up saying "Hello!"
```

An example of pressing uppercase `A`

```ruby
page.keyboard.press("Shift+KeyA")
# or
page.keyboard.press("Shift+A")
```

An example to trigger select-all with the keyboard

```ruby
# RECOMMENDED
page.keyboard.press("ControlOrMeta+A")

# or just on windows and linux
page.keyboard.press("Control+A")
# or just on macOS
page.keyboard.press("Meta+A")
```

## down

```
def down(key)
```


Dispatches a `keydown` event.

`key` can specify the intended
[keyboardEvent.key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) value or a single character to
generate the text for. A superset of the `key` values can be found
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values). Examples of the keys are:

`F1` - `F12`, `Digit0`- `Digit9`, `KeyA`- `KeyZ`, `Backquote`, `Minus`, `Equal`, `Backslash`, `Backspace`, `Tab`,
`Delete`, `Escape`, `ArrowDown`, `End`, `Enter`, `Home`, `Insert`, `PageDown`, `PageUp`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUp`, etc.

Following modification shortcuts are also supported: `Shift`, `Control`, `Alt`, `Meta`, `ShiftLeft`, `ControlOrMeta`.
`ControlOrMeta` resolves to `Control` on Windows and Linux and to `Meta` on macOS.

Holding down `Shift` will type the text that corresponds to the `key` in the upper case.

If `key` is a single character, it is case-sensitive, so the values `a` and `A` will generate different
respective texts.

If `key` is a modifier key, `Shift`, `Meta`, `Control`, or `Alt`, subsequent key presses will be sent with that
modifier active. To release the modifier key, use [Keyboard#up](./keyboard#up).

After the key is pressed once, subsequent calls to [Keyboard#down](./keyboard#down) will have
[repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/repeat) set to true. To release the key, use
[Keyboard#up](./keyboard#up).

**NOTE**: Modifier keys DO influence `keyboard.down`. Holding down `Shift` will type the text in upper case.

## insert_text

```
def insert_text(text)
```


Dispatches only `input` event, does not emit the `keydown`, `keyup` or `keypress` events.

**Usage**

```ruby
page.keyboard.insert_text("å—¨")
```

**NOTE**: Modifier keys DO NOT effect `keyboard.insertText`. Holding down `Shift` will not type the text in upper case.

## press

```
def press(key, delay: nil)
```


**NOTE**: In most cases, you should use [Locator#press](./locator#press) instead.

`key` can specify the intended
[keyboardEvent.key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) value or a single character to
generate the text for. A superset of the `key` values can be found
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values). Examples of the keys are:

`F1` - `F12`, `Digit0`- `Digit9`, `KeyA`- `KeyZ`, `Backquote`, `Minus`, `Equal`, `Backslash`, `Backspace`, `Tab`,
`Delete`, `Escape`, `ArrowDown`, `End`, `Enter`, `Home`, `Insert`, `PageDown`, `PageUp`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUp`, etc.

Following modification shortcuts are also supported: `Shift`, `Control`, `Alt`, `Meta`, `ShiftLeft`, `ControlOrMeta`.
`ControlOrMeta` resolves to `Control` on Windows and Linux and to `Meta` on macOS.

Holding down `Shift` will type the text that corresponds to the `key` in the upper case.

If `key` is a single character, it is case-sensitive, so the values `a` and `A` will generate different
respective texts.

Shortcuts such as `key: "Control+o"`, `key: "Control++` or `key: "Control+Shift+T"` are supported as well. When specified with the
modifier, modifier is pressed and being held while the subsequent key is being pressed.

**Usage**

```ruby
page.goto("https://keycode.info")
page.keyboard.press("a")
page.screenshot(path: "a.png")
page.keyboard.press("ArrowLeft")
page.screenshot(path: "arrow_left.png")
page.keyboard.press("Shift+O")
page.screenshot(path: "o.png")
```

Shortcut for [Keyboard#down](./keyboard#down) and [Keyboard#up](./keyboard#up).

## type

```
def type(text, delay: nil)
```


**NOTE**: In most cases, you should use [Locator#fill](./locator#fill) instead. You only need to press keys one by one if there is special keyboard handling on the page - in this case use [Locator#press_sequentially](./locator#press_sequentially).

Sends a `keydown`, `keypress`/`input`, and `keyup` event for each character in the text.

To press a special key, like `Control` or `ArrowDown`, use [Keyboard#press](./keyboard#press).

**Usage**

```ruby
page.keyboard.type("Hello") # types instantly
page.keyboard.type("World", delay: 100) # types slower, like a user
```

**NOTE**: Modifier keys DO NOT effect `keyboard.type`. Holding down `Shift` will not type the text in upper case.

**NOTE**: For characters that are not on a US keyboard, only an `input` event will be sent.

## up

```
def up(key)
```


Dispatches a `keyup` event.
