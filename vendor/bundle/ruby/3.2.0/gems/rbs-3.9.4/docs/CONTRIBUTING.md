## Introduction

The RBS repository contains the type definitions of Core API and Standard Libraries.
There are some discussions whether if it is the best to have them in this repository, but we have them and continue updating the files meanwhile.

The target version of the bundled type definitions is the latest _release_ of Ruby -- `3.1` as of January 2022.

**The core API** type definitions are in `core` directory.
You will find the familiar class names in the directory, like `string.rbs` or `array.rbs`.

**The standard libraries** type definitions are in `stdlib` directory.
They have the [third party repository](repo.md) structure.
There is a `set` directory for the `set` library, and it contains `0` directory.
Because RBS supports the latest release of Ruby, we have one set of RBS files which corresponds to the bundled versions of the libraries.

## Steps for Contribution

1. Pick the class/library you will work for.
2. Make a directory `stdlib/foo/0` if you work for one of the standard libraries.
3. Write RBS type definitions and tests.

You will typically follow the steps as follows:

1. Run `rbs prototype runtime` to generate list of methods.
2. Run `rbs annotate` to import RDoc comments.
3. Run `rake generate:stdlib_test[LIB]` to generate a test case.
4. Write the type definitions and tests.

See the next *Useful Tools* section and the guides above for writing and testing RBS files.

## Useful Tools

* `rbs prototype runtime --merge String`
  * Generate a prototype using runtime API.
  * `--merge` tells to use the method types in RBS if exists.
* `rbs prototype runtime --merge --method-owner=Numeric Integer`
  * You can use --method-owner if you want to print method of other classes too, for documentation purpose.
* `rbs annotate core/string.rbs`
  * Import RDoc comments.
  * The imported docs contain the description, *arglists*, and filenames to help writing types.
* `bin/query-rdoc String#initialize`
  * Print RDoc documents in the format you can copy-and-paste to RBS.
* `bin/sort core/string.rbs`
  * Sort declarations members in RBS files.
* `rbs -r LIB validate`
  Validate the syntax and some of the semantics.
* `rake generate:stdlib_test[String]`
  Scaffold the stdlib test.
* `rake test/stdlib/Array_test.rb`
  Run specific stdlib test with the path.

### Standard STDLIB Members Order

We define the standard members order so that ordering doesn't bother reading diffs or git-annotate outputs.

1. `def self.new` or `def initialize`
2. Mixins
3. Attributes
4. Singleton methods
5. `public` & public instance methods
6. `private` & private instance methods

```rbs
class HelloWorld[X]
  def self.new: [A] () { (void) -> A } -> HelloWorld[A]         # new or initialize comes first
  def initialize: () -> void

  include Enumerable[X, void]                                   # Mixin comes next

  attr_reader language: (:ja | :en)                             # Attributes

  def self.all_languages: () -> Array[Symbol]                   # Singleton methods

  public                                                        # Public instance methods

  def each: () { (A) -> void } -> void                          # Members are sorted dictionary order

  def to_s: (?Locale) -> String

  private                                                       # Private instance methods

  alias validate validate_locale

  def validate_locale: () -> void
end
```

## Q&A

### Some of the standard libraries are gems. Why we put the files in this repo?

You are correct. We want to move to their repos. We haven't started the migration yet.

### How can we handle incompatibilities of core APIs and standard libraries between Rubies

We ignore the incompatibilities for now.
We focus on the latest version of core APIs and standard libraries.
