# <!-- rdoc-file=lib/rubygems/installer.rb -->
# The installer installs the files contained in the .gem into the Gem.home.
#
# Gem::Installer does the work of putting files in all the right places on the
# filesystem including unpacking the gem into its gem dir, installing the
# gemspec in the specifications dir, storing the cached gem in the cache dir,
# and installing either wrappers or symlinks for executables.
#
# The installer invokes pre and post install hooks.  Hooks can be added either
# through a rubygems_plugin.rb file in an installed gem or via a
# rubygems/defaults/#{RUBY_ENGINE}.rb or rubygems/defaults/operating_system.rb
# file.  See Gem.pre_install and Gem.post_install for details.
