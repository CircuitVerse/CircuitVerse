# <!-- rdoc-file=lib/rubygems/source_list.rb -->
# The SourceList represents the sources rubygems has been configured to use. A
# source may be created from an array of sources:
#
#     Gem::SourceList.from %w[https://rubygems.example https://internal.example]
#
# Or by adding them:
#
#     sources = Gem::SourceList.new
#     sources << 'https://rubygems.example'
#
# The most common way to get a SourceList is Gem.sources.
#
class Gem::SourceList
