  # Zlib::Deflate, an instance of this class is not able to duplicate (clone, dup)
  # itself.

    # dictionary is needed for decompression.
    #
    # This method is almost equivalent to the following code:

    # Inputs `deflate_string` into the inflate stream and returns the output from

    # like Zlib::ZStream#finish.
    #
    # If a block is given consecutive inflated chunks from the `deflate_string` are
    # yielded to the block and `nil` is returned.
    #
    # If a :buffer keyword argument is given and not nil:
    #
    # *   The :buffer keyword should be a String, and will used as the output
    #     buffer. Using this option can reuse the memory required during inflation.
    # *   When not passing a block, the return value will be the same object as the
    #     :buffer keyword argument.
    # *   When passing a block, the yielded chunks will be the same value as the
    #     :buffer keyword argument.

    # Creates a new inflate stream for decompression.  `window_bits` sets the size
    # of the history buffer and can have the following values:
    #
    # 0
    # :   Have inflate use the window size from the zlib header of the compressed
    #     stream.
    #
    #
    # (8..15)
    # :   Overrides the window size of the inflate header in the compressed stream.
    #     The window size must be greater than or equal to the window size of the
    #     compressed stream.
    #
    #
    # Greater than 15
    # :   Add 32 to window_bits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic
    #     header detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (a
    #     Zlib::DataError will be raised for a non-gzip stream).
    #
    #
    # (-8..-15)
    # :   Enables raw deflate mode which will not generate a check value, and will
    #     not look for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream.
    #
    #     This is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data
    #     format such as zip which provide their own check values.
    #
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     open "compressed.file" do |compressed_io|
    #       zi = Zlib::Inflate.new(Zlib::MAX_WBITS + 32)
    #

    #         open "uncompressed.file", "w+" do |uncompressed_io|
