module Zlib
  # <!-- rdoc-file=ext/zlib/zlib.c -->
  # Zlib::ZStream is the abstract class for the stream which handles the
  # compressed data. The operations are defined in the subclasses: Zlib::Deflate
  # for compression, and Zlib::Inflate for decompression.
  #
  # An instance of Zlib::ZStream has one stream (struct zstream in the source) and
  # two variable-length buffers which associated to the input (next_in) of the
  # stream and the output (next_out) of the stream. In this document, "input
  # buffer" means the buffer for input, and "output buffer" means the buffer for
  # output.
  #
  # Data input into an instance of Zlib::ZStream are temporally stored into the
  # end of input buffer, and then data in input buffer are processed from the
  # beginning of the buffer until no more output from the stream is produced (i.e.
  # until avail_out > 0 after processing).  During processing, output buffer is
  # allocated and expanded automatically to hold all output data.
  #
  # Some particular instance methods consume the data in output buffer and return
  # them as a String.
  #
  # Here is an ascii art for describing above:

  #     "output data"                                         "input data"
  #
  # If an error occurs during processing input buffer, an exception which is a
  # subclass of Zlib::Error is raised.  At that time, both input and output buffer
  # keep their conditions at the time when the error occurs.
  #
  # ## Method Catalogue
  #
  # Many of the methods in this class are fairly low-level and unlikely to be of
  # interest to users.  In fact, users are unlikely to use this class directly;
  # rather they will be interested in Zlib::Inflate and Zlib::Deflate.
  #
  # The higher level methods are listed below.

  # *   #total_in
  # *   #total_out
  # *   #data_type
  # *   #adler
  # *   #reset
  # *   #finish
  # *   #finished?
  # *   #close
  # *   #closed?
