# <!-- rdoc-file=lib/minitest/expectations.rb -->
# It's where you hide your "assertions".
#
# Please note, because of the way that expectations are implemented, all
# expectations (eg must_equal) are dependent upon a thread local variable
# `:current_spec`. If your specs rely on mixing threads into the specs
# themselves, you're better off using assertions or the new _(value) wrapper.
# For example:
#
#     it "should still work in threads" do
#       my_threaded_thingy do
#         (1+1).must_equal 2                  # bad
#         assert_equal 2, 1+1                 # good
#         _(1 + 1).must_equal 2               # good
#         value(1 + 1).must_equal 2           # good, also #expect
#         _ { 1 + "1" }.must_raise TypeError  # good
#       end
#     end
#
