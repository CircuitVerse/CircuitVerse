# <!-- rdoc-file=lib/minitest.rb -->
# A reporter that gathers statistics about a test run. Does not do any IO
# because meant to be used as a parent class for a reporter that does.
#
# If you want to create an entirely different type of output (eg, CI, HTML,
# etc), this is the place to start.
#
# Example:
#
#     class JenkinsCIReporter < StatisticsReporter
#       def report
#         super  # Needed to calculate some statistics
#
#         print "<testsuite "
#         print "tests='#{count}' "
#         print "failures='#{failures}' "
#         # Remaining XML...
#       end
#     end
#
