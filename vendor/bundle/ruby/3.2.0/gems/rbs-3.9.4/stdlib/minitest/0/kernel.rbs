  # Defines a test class subclassing from either Minitest::Spec or from the
  # surrounding describe's class. The surrounding class may subclass
  # Minitest::Spec manually in order to easily share code:
  #
  #     class MySpec < Minitest::Spec
  #       # ... shared code ...
  #     end

  #       it "does stuff" do
  #         # shared code available here
  #       end
  #       describe "inner stuff" do
  #         it "still does stuff" do
  #           # ...and here
  #         end
  #       end
