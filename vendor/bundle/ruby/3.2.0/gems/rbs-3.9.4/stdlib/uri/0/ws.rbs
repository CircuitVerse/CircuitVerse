  # The syntax of WS URIs is defined in RFC6455 section 3.
  #
  # Note that the Ruby URI library allows WS URLs containing usernames and
  # passwords. This is not legal as per the RFC, but used to be supported in
  # Internet Explorer 5 and 6, before the MS04-004 security update. See
  # <URL:http://support.microsoft.com/kb/834489>.
