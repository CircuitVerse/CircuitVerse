*   Respect `html_options[:form]` when `collection_checkboxes` generates the
    hidden `<input>`.

    *Riccardo Odone*

*   Layouts have access to local variables passed to `render`.

    This fixes #31680 which was a regression in Rails 5.1.

    *Mike Dalessio*

*   Argument errors related to strict locals in templates now raise an
    `ActionView::StrictLocalsError`, and all other argument errors are reraised as-is.

    Previously, any `ArgumentError` raised during template rendering was swallowed during strict
    local error handling, so that an `ArgumentError` unrelated to strict locals (e.g., a helper
    method invoked with incorrect arguments) would be replaced by a similar `ArgumentError` with an
    unrelated backtrace, making it difficult to debug templates.

    Now, any `ArgumentError` unrelated to strict locals is reraised, preserving the original
    backtrace for developers.

    Also note that `ActionView::StrictLocalsError` is a subclass of `ArgumentError`, so any existing
    code that rescues `ArgumentError` will continue to work.

    Fixes #52227.

*   Fix stack overflow error in dependency tracker when dealing with circular dependencies

## Rails 8.0.1 (December 13, 2024) ##

*   Fix a crash in ERB template error highlighting when the error occurs on a
    line in the compiled template that is past the end of the source template.

    *Martin Emde*

*   Improve reliability of ERB template error highlighting.
    Fix infinite loops and crashes in highlighting and
    improve tolerance for alternate ERB handlers.

## Rails 8.0.0.beta1 (September 26, 2024) ##

*   Enable DependencyTracker to evaluate renders with trailing interpolation.

    ```erb
    <%= render "maintenance_tasks/runs/info/#{run.status}" %>
    ```

    Previously, the DependencyTracker would ignore this render, but now it will
    mark all partials in the "maintenance_tasks/runs/info" folder as
    dependencies.

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Rename `text_area` methods into `textarea`

    Old names are still available as aliases.

    *Sean Doyle*

*   Rename `check_box*` methods into `checkbox*`.

    Old names are still available as aliases.
