# RBS Generator for Active Record models

The RBS generator for Active Record models focus on generating methods that are generated by Active Record.
For example, it generates the following things.

* Classes which inherit `ActiveRecord::Base`
* Generated methods by Active Record
  * Column methods. e.g. `name` and `name=` methods for `name` column.
  * Relation methods. e.g. `users` and `users=` methods for `has_many :users`.
  * And so on.

I designed it generates "valid" RBSs. "valid" means the generated RBSs pass `rbs validate` only with `rbs collection`.
So if you need to do something to pass `rbs validate`, it's a bug. For example, if you see `RBS::NoSuperclassFoundError` for the generated RBS, it is a bug.

RBS Rails focuses on generating "generated" methods. It means it doesn't generate methods that are defined by the user.
For example:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # RBS Rails generates articles methods and so on
  # becasue they are generated by Active Record.
  has_many :articles

  # RBS Rails does NOT generate full_name method
  # because the user defines it.
  def full_name
    first_name + last_name
  end
end
```

You can use `rbs prototype rb`, `rbs prototype runtime` and `typeprof` commands to generate them.
