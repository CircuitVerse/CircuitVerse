## Code of Conduct

mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these
guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce
the behavior, and find related reports.

- Before creating bug reports, please check the open issues; somebody may
  already have submitted something similar, and you may not need to create a new
  one.

  possible, with an example reproducing the issue.

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Changelog

- Add a message describing your changes to the "Unreleased" section. The
  changelog message should follow the same style as the commit message.

  - `[Added]` for new features.

  - `[Deprecated]` for soon-to-be removed features.
  - `[Removed]` for now removed features.
  - `[Fixed]` for any bug fixes.
  - `[Security]` in case of vulnerabilities.

### Ruby code

  submitting your changes, make sure your tests are passing and code conforms to
  the expected style by running `rake`.
- Do not change the library version. This will be done by the maintainer
  whenever a new version is about to be released.

  submitting your changes, make sure your tests are passing and code conforms to
  the expected style by running `yarn test:ci`.
