    [CVE-2025-24293]

## Rails 8.0.2 (March 12, 2025) ##

*   A Blob will no longer autosave associated Attachment.

    This fixes an issue where a record with an attachment would have
    its dirty attributes reset, preventing your `after commit` callbacks
    on that record to behave as expected.

    Note that this change doesn't require any changes on your application
    and is supposed to be internal. Active Storage Attachment will continue
    to be autosaved (through a different relation).

*   Improve `ActiveStorage::Filename#sanitized` method to handle special characters more effectively.
    Replace the characters `"*?<>` with `-` if they exist in the Filename to match the Filename convention of Win OS.

*   Improve InvariableError, UnpreviewableError and UnrepresentableError message.

    Include Blob ID and content_type in the messages.
