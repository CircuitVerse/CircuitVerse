  # Engine Configuration

  # current_user_proc
  # Type: Proc
  # Arguments: the current controller (ActionController::Base)
  # Returns: the current user (acts_as_commontator)
  # The default works for Devise and similar authentication plugins

  # javascript_proc
  # Type: Proc
  # Arguments: a view (ActionView::Base)
  # Returns: a String that is appended to Commontator JS views
  # Can be used, for example, to display/clear Rails error messages
  # or to reapply JQuery UI styles after Ajax calls
  # Objects visible in view templates can be accessed
  # through the view object (for example, view.flash)
  # However, the view does not include the main application's helpers
  # Default: ->(view) { '$("#error_explanation").remove();' }

  # User (acts_as_commontator) Configuration

  # user_name_proc
  # Type: Proc
  # Arguments: a user (acts_as_commontator)

  # Arguments: a user (acts_as_commontator),
  #            the app_routes (ActionDispatch::Routing::RoutesProxy)
  # Returns: a path to the user's `show` page (String)

  # user_avatar_proc
  # Type: Proc
  # Arguments: a user (acts_as_commontator), a view (ActionView::Base)
  # Returns: a String containing a HTML <img> tag pointing to the user's avatar image

  # a border size and an options hash for Gravatar, and produces a Gravatar image tag
  # See available options at http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/)
  # Note: Gravatar has several security implications for your users
  #       It makes your users trackable across different sites and
  #       allows de-anonymization attacks against their email addresses
  #       If you absolutely want to keep users' email addresses or identities secret,
  #       do not use Gravatar or similar services
  # Default: ->(user, view) {

  # Type: Proc
  # Arguments: a user (acts_as_commontator), a mailer (ActionMailer::Base)
  # Returns: the user's email address (String)
  # The default works for Devise's defaults
  # If the mailer argument is nil, Commontator intends to hash the email and send the hash
  # to Gravatar, so you should always return the user's email address (if using Gravatar)
  # If the mailer argument is not nil, then Commontator intends to send an email to
  # the address returned; you can prevent it from being sent by returning a blank String
  # Default: ->(user, mailer) { user.try(:email) || '' }

  # Example: Commontator::Comment.arel_table[:deleted_at].eq(nil) (hides deleted comments)
  #          This is not recommended, as it can cause confusion over deleted comments
  #          If using pagination, it can also cause comments to change pages
  # Default: nil (no filtering - all comments are visible)

  # thread_read_proc
  # Type: Proc
  # Arguments: a thread (Commontator::Thread), a user (acts_as_commontator)

  # Notes:
