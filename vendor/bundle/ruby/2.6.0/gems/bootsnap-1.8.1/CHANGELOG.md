# Unreleased

# 1.8.1

* Fixed support for older Psych. (#369)

# 1.8.0

* Improve support for Pysch 4. (#368)

# 1.7.7

* Fix `require_relative` in evaled code on latest ruby 3.1.0-dev. (#366)

# 1.7.6

* Fix `Encoding::UndefinedConversionError` error for Rails applications when precompiling cache. (#364)

# 1.7.5

* Gracefully handle read-only file system as well as other errors preventing to persist the load path cache. (#358)

# 1.7.4

* Stop raising errors when encoutering various file system errors. The cache is now best effort,
  if somehow it can't be saved, bootsnapp will gracefully fallback to the original operation (e.g. `Kernel.require`).
  (#353, #177, #262)

# 1.7.3

# 1.5.1

* Workaround a Ruby bug in InstructionSequence.compile_file. (#332)

# 1.5.0

* Add a command line to statically precompile the ISeq cache. (#326)

# 1.4.9

# 1.4.7

* Various performance enhancements
* Fix race condition in heavy concurrent load scenarios that would cause bootsnap to raise

# 1.4.6

* Fix bug that was erroneously considering that files containing `.` in the names were being
  required if a different file with the same name was already being required

      require 'foo'
      require 'foo.en'

  Before bootsnap was considering `foo.en` to be the same file as `foo`

* Fix bug with propagation of `NameError` up from nested calls to `require`

# 1.4.1

* Don't register change observers to frozen objects.

# 1.4.0

* When running in development mode, always fall back to a full path scan on LoadError, making
  bootsnap more able to detect newly-created files. (#230)
* Respect `$LOADED_FEATURES.delete` in order to support code reloading, for integration with
  Zeitwerk. (#230)
* Minor performance improvement: flow-control exceptions no longer generate backtraces.

* Minor performance savings around checking validity of cache in the presence of relative paths.
* When coverage is enabled, skips optimization instead of exploding.

# 0.3.1
