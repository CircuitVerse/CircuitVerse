    # The DatabaseSelector Middleware provides a framework for automatically
    # swapping from the primary to the replica database connection. Rails
    # provides a basic framework to determine when to swap and allows for
    # applications to write custom strategy classes to override the default
    # behavior.
    #
    # The resolver class defines when the application should switch (i.e. read
    # from the primary if a write occurred less than 2 seconds ago) and a
    # resolver context class that sets a value that helps the resolver class
    # decide when to switch.
    #
    # Rails default middleware uses the request's session to set a timestamp
    # that informs the application when to read from a primary or read from a
    # replica.
    #
    # To use the DatabaseSelector in your application with default settings add
    # the following options to your environment config:
    #
    #   config.active_record.database_selector = { delay: 2.seconds }
    #   config.active_record.database_resolver = ActiveRecord::Middleware::DatabaseSelector::Resolver
    #   config.active_record.database_resolver_context = ActiveRecord::Middleware::DatabaseSelector::Resolver::Session
    #
    # New applications will include these lines commented out in the production.rb.
    #
    # The default behavior can be changed by setting the config options to a
    # custom class:
    #
    #   config.active_record.database_selector = { delay: 2.seconds }
    #   config.active_record.database_resolver = MyResolver
    #   config.active_record.database_resolver_context = MyResolver::MySession
