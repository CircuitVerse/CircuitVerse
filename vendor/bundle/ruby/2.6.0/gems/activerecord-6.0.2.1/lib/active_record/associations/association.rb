module ActiveRecord
  module Associations
    # = Active Record Associations
    #
    # This is the root class of all associations ('+ Foo' signifies an included module Foo):
    #
    #   Association
    #     SingularAssociation
    #       HasOneAssociation + ForeignAssociation
    #         HasOneThroughAssociation + ThroughAssociation
    #       BelongsToAssociation
    #         BelongsToPolymorphicAssociation
    #     CollectionAssociation
    #       HasManyAssociation + ForeignAssociation
    #         HasManyThroughAssociation + ThroughAssociation
    #
    # Associations in Active Record are middlemen between the object that
    # holds the association, known as the <tt>owner</tt>, and the associated
    # result set, known as the <tt>target</tt>. Association metadata is available in
    # <tt>reflection</tt>, which is an instance of <tt>ActiveRecord::Reflection::AssociationReflection</tt>.
    #
    # For example, given
    #
    #   class Blog < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :posts
    #   end
    #
    #   blog = Blog.first
    #
    # The association of <tt>blog.posts</tt> has the object +blog+ as its
    # <tt>owner</tt>, the collection of its posts as <tt>target</tt>, and
    # the <tt>reflection</tt> object represents a <tt>:has_many</tt> macro.
