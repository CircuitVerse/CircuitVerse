      #
      # ==== Parameters
      #
      # * +id+ - This should be the id or an array of ids to be updated.
      # * +attributes+ - This should be a hash of attributes or an array of hashes.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   # Updates one record
      #   Person.update(15, user_name: "Samuel", group: "expert")

      #   # Updates multiple records

      # Note: Updating a large number of records will run an UPDATE
      # query for each record, which may cause a performance issue.
      # When running callbacks is not needed for each record update,
      # it is preferred to use {update_all}[rdoc-ref:Relation#update_all]
      # for updating all records in a single query.

      # Destroy an object (or multiple objects) that has the given id. The object is instantiated first,
      # therefore all callbacks and filters are fired off before the object is deleted. This method is
      # less efficient than #delete but allows cleanup methods and other actions to be run.
      #
      # This essentially finds the object (or multiple objects) with the given id, creates a new object
      # from the attributes, and then calls destroy on it.
      #
      # ==== Parameters
      #
      # * +id+ - This should be the id or an array of ids to be destroyed.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   # Destroy a single object
      #   Todo.destroy(1)
      #
      #   # Destroy multiple objects
      #   todos = [1,2,3]

      # executed, including any <tt>:dependent</tt> association options.
      #
      # You can delete multiple rows at once by passing an Array of <tt>id</tt>s.
      #
      # Note: Although it is often much faster than the alternative, #destroy,
      # skipping callbacks might bypass business logic in your application
      # that ensures referential integrity or performs other essential jobs.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   # Delete a single row

    #   account.id = 1
    #   account.reload

    #   # => #<Account id: 1, email: 'account@example.com'>
    #
    # Attributes are reloaded from the database, and caches busted, in
    # particular the associations cache and the QueryCache.
    #
    # If the record no longer exists in the database ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    # is raised. Otherwise, in addition to the in-place modification the method
    # returns +self+ for convenience.
    #
    # The optional <tt>:lock</tt> flag option allows you to lock the reloaded record:
    #
    #   reload(lock: true) # reload with pessimistic locking
    #
    # Reloading is commonly used in test suites to test something is actually
    # written to the database, or when some action modifies the corresponding
    # row in the database but not the object in memory:
    #
    #   assert account.deposit!(25)
    #   assert_equal 25, account.credit        # check it is updated in memory
    #   assert_equal 25, account.reload.credit # check it is also persisted
    #
    # Another common use case is optimistic locking handling:
    #
    #   def with_optimistic_retry
    #     begin
    #       yield
    #     rescue ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError
    #       begin
    #         # Reload lock_version in particular.
    #         reload
    #       rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    #         # If the record is gone there is nothing to do.
