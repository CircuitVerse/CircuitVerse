    # Connection pool base class for managing Active Record database
    # connections.
    #
    # == Introduction
    #
    # A connection pool synchronizes thread access to a limited number of
    # database connections. The basic idea is that each thread checks out a
    # database connection from the pool, uses that connection, and checks the
    # connection back in. ConnectionPool is completely thread-safe, and will
    # ensure that a connection cannot be used by two threads at the same time,
    # as long as ConnectionPool's contract is correctly followed. It will also
    # handle cases in which there are more threads than connections: if all
    # connections have been checked out, and a thread tries to checkout a
    # connection anyway, then ConnectionPool will wait until some other thread
    # has checked in a connection.
    #
    # == Obtaining (checking out) a connection
    #
    # Connections can be obtained and used from a connection pool in several
    # ways:
    #
    # 1. Simply use {ActiveRecord::Base.connection}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionHandling.connection]
    #    as with Active Record 2.1 and
    #    earlier (pre-connection-pooling). Eventually, when you're done with
    #    the connection(s) and wish it to be returned to the pool, you call
    #    {ActiveRecord::Base.clear_active_connections!}[rdoc-ref:ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionHandler#clear_active_connections!].
    #    This will be the default behavior for Active Record when used in conjunction with
    #    Action Pack's request handling cycle.
    # 2. Manually check out a connection from the pool with
    #    {ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.checkout}[rdoc-ref:#checkout]. You are responsible for
    #    returning this connection to the pool when finished by calling
    #    {ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.checkin(connection)}[rdoc-ref:#checkin].
    # 3. Use {ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection(&block)}[rdoc-ref:#with_connection], which
    #    obtains a connection, yields it as the sole argument to the block,
    #    and returns it to the pool after the block completes.
    #
    # Connections in the pool are actually AbstractAdapter objects (or objects
    # compatible with AbstractAdapter's interface).
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # There are several connection-pooling-related options that you can add to
    # your database connection configuration:
    #
    # * +pool+: maximum number of connections the pool may manage (default 5).
    # * +idle_timeout+: number of seconds that a connection will be kept
    #   unused in the pool before it is automatically disconnected (default
    #   300 seconds). Set this to zero to keep connections forever.
    # * +checkout_timeout+: number of seconds to wait for a connection to
    #   become available before giving up and raising a timeout error (default
    #   5 seconds).
    #
    #--
    # Synchronization policy:
    # * all public methods can be called outside +synchronize+
    # * access to these instance variables needs to be in +synchronize+:
    #   * @connections
    #   * @now_connecting
    # * private methods that require being called in a +synchronize+ blocks
    #   are now explicitly documented

    #   development:
    #     database: my_application
    #     host: localhost
    #
    #   library_db:
    #     database: library
    #     host: some.library.org
    #
    # Your primary database in the development environment is "my_application"
    # but the Book model connects to a separate database called "library_db"
    # (this can even be a database on a different machine).
    #
    # Book, ScaryBook and GoodBook will all use the same connection pool to
    # "library_db" while Author, BankAccount, and any other models you create
    # will use the default connection pool to "my_application".
    #
    # The various connection pools are managed by a single instance of
    # ConnectionHandler accessible via ActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler.
    # All Active Record models use this handler to determine the connection pool that they
    # should use.
    #
    # The ConnectionHandler class is not coupled with the Active models, as it has no knowledge
