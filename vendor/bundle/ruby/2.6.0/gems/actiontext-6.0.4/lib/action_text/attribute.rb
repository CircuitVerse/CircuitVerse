      # Provides access to a dependent RichText model that holds the body and attachments for a single named rich text attribute.
      # This dependent attribute is lazily instantiated and will be auto-saved when it's been changed. Example:
      #
      #   class Message < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     has_rich_text :content
      #   end
      #
      #   message = Message.create!(content: "<h1>Funny times!</h1>")
      #   message.content.to_s # => "<h1>Funny times!</h1>"
      #   message.content.to_plain_text # => "Funny times!"
      #
      # The dependent RichText model will also automatically process attachments links as sent via the Trix-powered editor.
      # These attachments are associated with the RichText model using Active Storage.
      #
      # If you wish to preload the dependent RichText model, you can use the named scope:
      #
      #   Message.all.with_rich_text_content # Avoids N+1 queries when you just want the body, not the attachments.
      #   Message.all.with_rich_text_content_and_embeds # Avoids N+1 queries when you just want the body and attachments.
