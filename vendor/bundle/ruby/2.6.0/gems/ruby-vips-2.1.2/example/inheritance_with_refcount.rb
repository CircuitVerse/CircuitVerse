  # we have a set of things we need to inherit in different ways:
  #
  # - we want to be able to subclass GObject in a simple way
  # - the layouts of the nested structs
  # - casting between structs which share a base
  # - gobject refcounting
  #
  # the solution is to split the class into four areas which we treat
  # differently:
  #
  # - we have a "wrapper" Ruby class to allow easy subclassing ... this has a
  #   @struct member which holds the actual pointer
  # - we use "forwardable" to forward the various ffi methods on to the
  #   @struct member ... we arrange things so that subclasses do not need to
  #   do the forwarding themselves
  # - we have two versions of the struct: a plain one which we can use for
  #   casting that will not change the refcounts
  # - and a managed one with an unref which we just use for .new
  # - we separate the struct layout into a separate module to avoid repeating
  #   ourselves
