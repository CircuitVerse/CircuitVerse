module ActiveStorage
  # Abstract class serving as an interface for concrete services.
  #
  # The available services are:
  #
  # * +Disk+, to manage attachments saved directly on the hard drive.
  # * +GCS+, to manage attachments through Google Cloud Storage.
  # * +S3+, to manage attachments through Amazon S3.
  # * +AzureStorage+, to manage attachments through Microsoft Azure Storage.
  # * +Mirror+, to be able to use several services to manage attachments.
  #
  # Inside a Rails application, you can set-up your services through the
  # generated <tt>config/storage.yml</tt> file and reference one
  # of the aforementioned constant under the +service+ key. For example:
  #
  #   local:
  #     service: Disk
  #     root: <%= Rails.root.join("storage") %>
  #
  # You can checkout the service's constructor to know which keys are required.
  #
  # Then, in your application's configuration, you can specify the service to
  # use like this:
  #
  #   config.active_storage.service = :local
  #
  # If you are using Active Storage outside of a Ruby on Rails application, you
  # can configure the service to use like this:
  #
  #   ActiveStorage::Blob.service = ActiveStorage::Service.configure(
  #     :Disk,
  #     root: Pathname("/foo/bar/storage")
  #   )
