# Some non-image blobs can be previewed: that is, they can be presented as images. A video blob can be previewed by
# extracting its first frame, and a PDF blob can be previewed by extracting its first page.
#
# A previewer extracts a preview image from a blob. Active Storage provides previewers for videos and PDFs:
# ActiveStorage::Previewer::VideoPreviewer and ActiveStorage::Previewer::PDFPreviewer. Build custom previewers by
# subclassing ActiveStorage::Previewer and implementing the requisite methods. Consult the ActiveStorage::Previewer
# documentation for more details on what's required of previewers.
#
# To choose the previewer for a blob, Active Storage calls +accept?+ on each registered previewer in order. It uses the
# first previewer for which +accept?+ returns true when given the blob. In a Rails application, add or remove previewers
# by manipulating +Rails.application.config.active_storage.previewers+ in an initializer:
#
#   Rails.application.config.active_storage.previewers
#   # => [ ActiveStorage::Previewer::PDFPreviewer, ActiveStorage::Previewer::VideoPreviewer ]
#
#   # Add a custom previewer for Microsoft Office documents:
#   Rails.application.config.active_storage.previewers << DOCXPreviewer
#   # => [ ActiveStorage::Previewer::PDFPreviewer, ActiveStorage::Previewer::VideoPreviewer, DOCXPreviewer ]
#
# Outside of a Rails application, modify +ActiveStorage.previewers+ instead.
#
# The built-in previewers rely on third-party system libraries. Specifically, the built-in video previewer requires
# {FFmpeg}[https://www.ffmpeg.org]. Two PDF previewers are provided: one requires {Poppler}[https://poppler.freedesktop.org],
# and the other requires {muPDF}[https://mupdf.com] (version 1.8 or newer). To preview PDFs, install either Poppler or muPDF.
#
# These libraries are not provided by Rails. You must install them yourself to use the built-in previewers. Before you
# install and use third-party software, make sure you understand the licensing implications of doing so.
