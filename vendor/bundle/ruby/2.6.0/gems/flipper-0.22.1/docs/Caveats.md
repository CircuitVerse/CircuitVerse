# Caveats

1. The [individual actor gate](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/master/docs/Gates.md#2-individual-actor) is typically not designed for hundreds or thousands of actors to be enabled. This is an explicit choice to make it easier to batch load data from the adapters instead of performing individual checks for actors over and over. If you need to enable something for more than 100 individual actors, I would recommend using a [group](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/master/docs/Gates.md#5-group).
2. The `disable` method exists only to clear something that is enabled. If the thing you are disabling is not enabled, the disable is pointless. This means that if you enable one group an actor is in and disable another group, the feature will be enabled for the actor. ([related issue](https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/issues/71))
