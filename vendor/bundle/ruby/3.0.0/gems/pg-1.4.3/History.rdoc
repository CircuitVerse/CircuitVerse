== v1.3.0 [2022-01-20] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Install Enhancements:
- Print some install help if libpq wasn't found. #396
  This should help to pick the necessary package without googling.

- Add binary Windows gems for Ruby 3.0 and 3.1.
- Make the library path of libpq available in ruby as PG::POSTGRESQL_LIB_PATH and add it to the search paths on Windows similar to +rpath+ on Unix systems. #373
- Fall back to pkg-config if pg_config is not found. #380
- Add option to extconf.rb to disable nogvl-wrapping of libpq functions.
  All methods (except PG::Connection.ping) are nonblocking now, so that GVL unlock is in theory no longer necessary.
  However it can have some advantage in concurrency, so that GVL unlock is still enabled by default.
  Use:
  - gem inst pg -- --disable-gvl-unlock

API Enhancements:
- Add full compatibility to Fiber.scheduler introduced in Ruby-3.0. #397

  - Make discard_results scheduler friendly
  - Do all socket waiting through the conn.socket_io object.
  - Avoid PG.connect blocking while address resolution by automatically providing the +hostaddr+ parameter and resolving in Ruby instead of libpq.
  - On Windows Fiber.scheduler support requires Ruby-3.1+.
    It is also only partly usable since may ruby IO methods are not yet scheduler aware on Windows.
- Add support for pipeline mode of PostgreSQL-14. #401
- Allow specification of multiple hosts in PostgreSQL URI. #387
- Add new method conn.backend_key - used to implement our own cancel method.

Type cast enhancements:
- Add PG::BasicTypeMapForQueries::BinaryData for encoding of bytea columns. #348
- Reduce time to build coder maps and permit to reuse them for several type maps per PG::BasicTypeRegistry::CoderMapsBundle.new(conn) . #376
- Make BasicTypeRegistry a class and use a global default instance of it.
  Now a local type registry can be instanciated and given to the type map, to avoid changing shared global states.
- Allow PG::BasicTypeMapForQueries to take a Proc as callback for undefined types.

Other Enhancements:
- Convert all PG classes implemented in C to TypedData objects. #349
- Support ObjectSpace.memsize_of(obj) on all classes implemented in C. #393

  Fall back to rb_wait_for_single_fd() on ruby < 3.0.
- On Windows use a specialized wait function as a workaround for very poor performance of rb_io_wait(). #416

Bugfixes:
- Release GVL while calling PQping which is a blocking method, but it didn't release GVL so far.
- Fix Connection#transaction to no longer block on interrupts, for instance when pressing Ctrl-C and cancel a running query. #390
- Avoid casting of OIDs to fix compat with Redshift database. #369
- Call conn.block before each conn.get_result call to avoid possible blocking in case of a slow network and multiple query results.
- Sporadic Errno::ENOTSOCK when using conn.socket_io on Windows #398

Deprecated:
- Add deprecation warning to PG::BasicTypeRegistry.register_type and siblings.

- Make use of PQresultMemorySize() of PostgreSQL-12 and fall back to our internal estimator.
- Improve performance of PG::Result#stream_each_tuple .
- Store client encoding in data part of PG::Connection and PG::Result objects, so that we no longer use ruby's internal encoding bits. #280
