# Flipper

> Beautiful, performant feature flags for Ruby.

Flipper gives you control over who has access to features in your app.

* Enable or disable features for everyone, specific actors, groups of actors, a percentage of actors, or a percentage of time.
* Configure your feature flags from the console or a web UI.
* Regardless of what data store you are using, Flipper can performantly store your feature flags.
* Use [Flipper Cloud](#flipper-cloud) to cascade features from multiple environments, share settings with your team, control permissions, keep an audit history, and rollback.

Control your software &mdash; don't let it control you.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'flipper'

You'll also want to pick a storage [adapter](https://flippercloud.io/docs/adapters), for example:

    gem 'flipper-active_record'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself with:

    $ gem install flipper

## Getting Started

Use `Flipper#enabled?` in your app to check if a feature is enabled.

```ruby
# check if search is enabled
if Flipper.enabled? :search, current_user
  puts 'Search away!'
else
  puts 'No search for you!'
end
```

All features are disabled by default, so you'll need to explicitly enable them.

```ruby
# Enable a feature for everyone
Flipper.enable :search

# Enable a feature for a specific actor
Flipper.enable_actor :search, current_user

# Enable a feature for a group of actors
Flipper.enable_group :search, :admin

# Enable a feature for a percentage of actors
Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors :search, 2
```

## Flipper Cloud

Like Flipper and want more? Check out [Flipper Cloud](https://www.flippercloud.io), which comes with:

* **everything in one place** &mdash; no need to bounce around from different application UIs or IRB consoles.
* **permissions** &mdash; grant access to everyone in your organization or lockdown each project to particular people.
* **multiple environments** &mdash; production, staging, enterprise, by continent, whatever you need.
* **personal environments** &mdash; no more rake scripts or manual enable/disable to get your laptop to look like production. Every developer gets a personal environment that inherits from production that they can override as they please ([read more](https://www.johnnunemaker.com/flipper-cloud-environments/)).
* **no maintenance** &mdash; we'll keep the lights on for you. We also have handy webhooks for keeping your app in sync with Cloud, so **our availability won't affect yours**. All your feature flag reads are local to your app.
* **audit history** &mdash; every feature change and who made it.
* **rollbacks** &mdash; enable or disable a feature accidentally? No problem. You can roll back to any point in the audit history with a single click.

Cloud is super simple to integrate with Rails ([demo app](https://github.com/fewerandfaster/flipper-rails-demo)), Sinatra or any other framework.
