    # local development with containers that are not to be exposed to the
    # outside world. We use vanilla "ruby" images and do not layer on any
    # additional software dependencies or configurations ourselves that would
    # change the original "ruby" images' security profile. We defer all
    # security mitigation for the images to the "ruby" image maintainers (who
    # themselves are periodically updating their base Ubuntu layers to mitigate
    # issues).
