module Sunspot
  #
  # Sunspot works by saving references to the primary key (or natural ID) of
  # each indexed object, and then retrieving the objects from persistent storage
  # when their IDs are referenced in search results. In order for Sunspot to
  # know what an object's primary key is, and how to retrieve objects from
  # persistent storage given a primary key, an adapter must be registered for
  # that object's class or one of its superclasses (for instance, an adapter
  # registered for ActiveRecord::Base would be used for all ActiveRecord
  # models).
  #
  # To provide Sunspot with this ability, adapters must have two roles:
  #
  # Data accessor::
  #   A subclass of Sunspot::Adapters::DataAccessor, this object is instantiated
  #   with a particular class and must respond to the #load() method, which
  #   returns an object from persistent storage given that object's primary key.
  #   It can also optionally implement the #load_all() method, which returns
  #   a collection of objects given a collection of primary keys, if that can be
  #   done more efficiently than calling #load() on each key.
  # Instance adapter::
  #   A subclass of Sunspot::Adapters::InstanceAdapter, this object is
  #   instantiated with a particular instance. Its only job is to tell Sunspot
  #   what the object's primary key is, by implementing the #id() method.
  #
  # Adapters are registered by registering their two components, telling Sunspot
  # that they are available for one or more classes, and all of their
  # subclasses. See Sunspot::Adapters::DataAccessor.register and
  # Sunspot::Adapters::InstanceAdapter.register for the details.
  #
  # See spec/mocks/mock_adapter.rb for an example of how adapter classes should
  # be implemented.
  #
  module Adapters
    # Subclasses of the InstanceAdapter class should implement the #id method,
    # which returns the primary key of the instance stored in the @instance
    # variable. The primary key must be unique within the scope of the
    # instance's class.
    #
    # ==== Example:
    #
    #   class FileAdapter < Sunspot::Adapters::InstanceAdapter
    #     def id
    #       File.expand_path(@instance.path)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   # then in your initializer
    #   Sunspot::Adapters::InstanceAdapter.register(FileAdapter, File)
    #
    class InstanceAdapter
      def initialize(instance) #:nodoc:
        @instance = instance
      end

      #

      #
      # ==== Returns
      #
      # String:: ID for use in Solr
      #
