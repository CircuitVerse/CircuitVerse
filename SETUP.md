# Setting up CircuitVerse
[Back to `README.md`](README.md)

## Setting up on cloud with Gitpod
[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) can be used to develop CircuitVerse in the cloud. Instructions are available in our [wiki](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/wiki/Development-on-Gitpod). Pull requests can be created in Gitpod by following these [steps](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/wiki/Pull-Requests-using-Gitpod).

## Setting up development environment on local machine

## Required Software
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - using a GUI such as [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) can help.
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)

# Versions
- Ruby Version: ruby-2.6.5
- Rails Version: Rails 6.0.1
- PostgreSQL Version: 9.5

## Cloning From GitHub
To clone the repository, either use the Git GUI if you have one installed or enter the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse.git
cd CircuitVerse
```
**Note:** If you want to contribute, first fork the original repository and clone the **forked** repository into your local machine. If you don't do this, you will not be able to make commits or change any files.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<username>/CircuitVerse.git
cd CircuitVerse
```

## Setup Instructions
Please go through the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before going forward with any development. This helps us keep the process streamlined and results in better PRs.
You will also need the required software, detailed above. `Redis` and `PostgreSQL` should be running.

**Note:** You might want to use the docker instructions if you do not want to setup your own environment.

1. Install ruby using RVM, use ruby-2.6.5
1. Install bundler : `gem install bundler`
1. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
1. Install Yarn dependencies: `yarn`
1. Configure your PostgreSQL database in `config/database.yml` (copy `config/database.example.yml` for the template)
     * **Note:** The Postgres credentials need to be updated to your currently running database
1. Create database: `rails db:create`
1. Run migrations: `rails db:migrate`
1. Start Sidekiq: `bundle exec sidekiq -e development -q default -q mailers -d -L tmp/sidekiq.log` (currently in development)

Then, local development can be started with `rails s -b 127.0.0.1 -p 8080`. Navigate to `127.0.0.1:8080` in your web browser to access the website.

### CircuitVerse API setup instructions
CircuitVerse API uses `RSASSA` cryptographic signing that requires `private` and associated `public` key. To generate the keys RUN the following commands in `CircuitVerse/`
```
openssl genrsa -out config/private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in config/private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out config/public.pem
```

### Additional setup instructions
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is a package manager for the JavaScript ecosystem.
CircuitVerse uses Yarn for frontend package and asset management.

If you encounter the following error,
```
Error: File to import not found or unreadable: bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss
```
run `yarn` to install frontend dependencies

Additional software:
* Install imagemagick
* Start Redis server process.
* To start sidekiq: `bundle exec sidekiq -e development -q default -q mailers -d -L tmp/sidekiq.log` (In development)

#### Webpack 
**Note:** CircuitVerse uses webpack to bundle the javascript module and assets. 
So to see any changes made to the simulator code aka. Hot Reload, on the local server, you need to start the `webpack-dev-server`.
This can be done by running the command:
```
bin/webpack-dev-server
```

### Development
Developers can quickly get started by setting up the dev environment using the instructions above. To seed the database with some sample data, run `bundle exec rake db:seed`. The admin credentials after seeding will be:
```
User: Admin
Email: admin@circuitverse.org
Password: password
```

For debugging include `binding.pry` anywhere inside the code to open the `pry` console.


### Production
The following commands should be run for production:
```
bundle install --with pg --without development test
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
bundle exec sidekiq -e production -q default -q mailers -d -L tmp/sidekiq.log
```

### Deploy to Heroku
You will be redirected to the Heroku page for deployment on clicking the below button.
Make sure that you fill in the `Config Vars` section before deploying it.

### Additional instructions for Ubuntu
Additional instructions can be found [here](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/ubuntu-ruby-on-rails/) and there are some extra notes for single user installations:
- If you are facing difficulties installing RVM, most probably it is because of an older version of rvm shipped with Ubuntu's desktop edition and updating the same resolves the problem.
- [Run Terminal as a login shell](https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/) so ruby and rails will be available.

  - Removing RVM
    ```
    sudo apt-get --purge remove ruby-rvm
    sudo rm -rf /usr/share/ruby-rvm /etc/rvmrc /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh
    ```
  - Installing new version of RVM
    ```
    curl -L https://get.rvm.io |
    bash -s stable --ruby --autolibs=enable --auto-dotfiles
    ```
- If you are facing errors running the `rails db:create` ensure that the socket file(i.e `mysql.sock`) is present in that location. Some possible locations where it might be present is `/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock` or `/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock`.

## Running Tests
Before making a pull request, it is a good idea to check that all tests are passing locally. To run the system tests, run `bundle exec rspec` or `bin/rake spec:all`

**Note:** To pass the system tests, you need the [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed.

## Docker Instructions
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) creates a virtual machine on your PC, which negates the need to install other software or issue the setup instructions manually. This is optional.

**Note:** Docker will not run on Windows 10 Home Edition.

### Usage
* Run `docker-compose up` to run the instance
* Run `docker-compose down` to stop the instance
* Run `docker-compose build --no-cache` to rebuild the instance (make sure the instance is not running first)


## Configuring Third Party Services
Follow these instructions if you would like to link `Google`, `Facebook` or `GitHub` to your CircuitVerse instance:
1. First create a Google, Facebook or Github app by following this [wiki](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/wiki/Create-Apps).
2. Make the following changes in your Google, Facebook or Github app:
   1.  Update the `site url` field with the URL of your instance, and update the `callback url` field with `<url>/users/auth/google`, `<url>/users/auth/facebook` or `<url>/users/auth/github` respectively.
3. Configure your `id` and `secret` environment variables in `.env`. If `.env` does not exist, copy the template from `.env.example`.
4. After adding the environment variables, run `dotenv rails server` to start the application.
