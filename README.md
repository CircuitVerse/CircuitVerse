 **# Feature Request: Add App Store Button to Footer #4414**

**## Problem Statement**

Currently, the Circuitverse website lacks any information about the Circuitverse app for Android, which is available on the Google Play Store. This could lead to users being unaware of the app's existence, potentially missing out on its features and benefits.

**## Proposed Solution**

To address this issue, we propose adding a button to the footer of the Circuitverse website that links directly to the Circuitverse app's page on the Google Play Store. This would serve several purposes:

- **Increase awareness:** It would make users aware of the app's availability, potentially increasing downloads and engagement.
- **Direct access:** It would provide a convenient way for users to access the app store page with a single click, streamlining the installation process.
- **Enhance user experience:** It would complement the website's functionality and offer 
a more seamless user experience by connecting users to the app.
