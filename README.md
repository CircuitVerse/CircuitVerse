- `cd CircuitVerse`

**Note :** If you want to contribute, first fork the original repository and clone the forked repository into your local machine followed by ```cd``` into the directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<username>/CircuitVerse.git
cd CircuitVerse
```

## Setup Instructions

Please go through the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before going forward with any development. This helps us keep the process streamlined and results in better PRs

**Note:** You might want to use the docker instructions if you do not want to setup your own environment.

* Install ruby using RVM, use ruby-2.5.1
* Install Dependencies: `bundle install `
* Configure your DB in config/database.yml, copy config/database.example.yml (Note : check for postgres password and update it in place of "postgres")
* Create database: `rails db:create`
* Run Migrations: `rails db:migrate`
* At this point, local development can be started with ```rails s -b 127.0.0.1 -p 8080```

Additional software:
* Install imagemagick
* Start Redis server process.
* To start sidekiq: `bundle exec sidekiq -e development -q default -q mailers -d -L tmp/sidekiq.log` (In development)

## Running Tests

Ensure all tests are passing locally before making a pull request. To run tests -
* `bundle exec rspec` or `bin/rake spec:all`

## Docker Instructions

* Install docker and docker-compose
* Run: `docker-compose up`

If you need to rebuild, run this before `docker-compose up`
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

## Developer Instructions
Developers can quickly get started by setting up the dev environment using the instructions above. The database is seeded with the following admin account.
```
User: Admin
Email: admin@circuitverse.org
Password: password
```

For debugging include `binding.pry` anywhere inside the code to open the `pry` console.

## Additional setup instructions for Ubuntu
Additional instructions can be found [here](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/ubuntu-ruby-on-rails/) and there are some extra notes for single user installations:

- If you are facing difficulties installing RVM, most probably it is because of an older version of rvm shipped with Ubuntu's desktop edition and updating the same resolves the problem.
- [Run Terminal as a login shell](https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/) so ruby and rails will be available.

  Removing RVM
  ```
  sudo apt-get --purge remove ruby-rvm` <br />
  sudo rm -rf /usr/share/ruby-rvm /etc/rvmrc /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh
  ```
  Installing new version of RVM
  ```
  curl -L https://get.rvm.io |
  bash -s stable --ruby --autolibs=enable --auto-dotfiles
  ```
- If you are facing errors running the `rails db:create` ensure that the socket file(i.e mysql.sock) is present in that location.   Some possible locations where it might be present is `/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock`  or `/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock` and mention the exact location.


## Production Specific Instructions

```
bundle install --with pg --without development test
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
bundle exec sidekiq -e production -q default -q mailers -d -L tmp/sidekiq.log` (In production)
```
