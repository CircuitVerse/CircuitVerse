[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/CircuitVerse/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/CircuitVerse/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

## Versions

- Ruby Version: ruby-2.5.1
- Rails Version: Rails 5.1.6
- PostgreSQL Version: 9.5

## Cloning Instructions

- `git clone https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse.git` this repository
- `cd CircuitVerse`

**Note :** If you want to contribute, first fork the original repository and clone the forked repository into your local machine followed by ```cd``` into the directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<username>/CircuitVerse.git
cd CircuitVerse
```

## Setup Instructions

**Note:** You might want to use the docker instructions if you do not want to setup your own environment.

* Install ruby using RVM, use ruby-2.5.1
* Install Dependencies: `bundle install --without production`
* Configure your DB in config/database.yml, copy config/database.yml.example
* Create database: `rails db:create`
* Run Migrations: `rails db:migrate`
* At this point, local development can be started with ```rails s -b 127.0.0.1 -p 8080```

Additional software:
* Install imagemagick
* Start Redis server process.
* To start sidekiq: `bundle exec sidekiq -e development -q default -q mailers -d -L tmp/sidekiq.log` (In development)

## Running Tests

Ensure all tests are passing locally before making a pull request. To run tests -
* `bundle exec rspec` or `bin/rake spec:all`

## Docker Instructions

* Install docker and docker-compose
* Run: `docker-compose up`

If you need to rebuild, run this before `docker-compose up`
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

## Developer Instructions
Developers can quickly get started by setting up the dev environment using the instructions above. The database is seeded with the following admin account.
```
User: Admin
Email: admin@circuitverse.org
Password: password
```

For debugging include `binding.pry` anywhere inside the code to open the `pry` console.

## Additional setup instructions for Ubuntu
Additional instructions can be found [here](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/ubuntu-ruby-on-rails/) and there are some extra notes for single user installations:
- If setting up Postgres with these instructions, use your user name instead of 'rails_dev'.
- [Run Terminal as a login shell](https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/) so ruby and rails will be available.
- You can remove `gem mysql2` from the gemfile (but don't check it in), move `gem pg` up and create the database.yml file with just Postgres. Example:
```
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  username: <your user name>
  password: <postgres password>

development:
  <<: *default
  database: circuitverse_development

test:
  <<: *default
  database: circuitverse_test

production:
  <<: *default
  database: circuitverse_production
  username: circuitverse
  password: <%= ENV['circuitverse_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

- If you are facing difficulties installing RVM, most probably it is because of an older version of rvm shipped with Ubuntu's desktop edition and updating the same resolves the problem.

  Removing RVM
  ```
  sudo apt-get --purge remove ruby-rvm` <br />
  sudo rm -rf /usr/share/ruby-rvm /etc/rvmrc /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh
  ```
  Installing new version of RVM
  ```
  curl -L https://get.rvm.io |
  bash -s stable --ruby --autolibs=enable --auto-dotfiles
  ```
- If you are facing errors running the `rails db:create` ensure that the socket file(i.e mysql.sock) is present in that location.   Some possible locations where it might be present is `/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock`  or `/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock` and mention the exact location.


## Production Specific Instructions

```
bundle install --without development test
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
bundle exec sidekiq -e production -q default -q mailers -d -L tmp/sidekiq.log` (In production)
```
