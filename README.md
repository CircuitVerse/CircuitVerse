# CircuitVerse Frontend Vue
[CircuitVerse Frontend Vue](https://circuitverse.netlify.app/simulatorvue) is dedicated to enhancing the CircuitVerse platform in several key ways. Our primary focus is on decoupling the [CircuitVerse Simulator](https://circuitverse.org/simulator) from the backend, allowing it to function independently and with greater flexibility. Additionally, we're working to remove the reliance on jQueryUI, opting for cleaner and more contemporary code practices. To improve performance and code readability, we're transitioning from traditional DOM mutations to string-based manipulation. Furthermore, we're actively integrating internationalization features to ensure the platform is accessible to users worldwide. In summary, our repository aims to elevate the capabilities and user experience of CircuitVerse through targeted improvements and optimizations.

[CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org) is a free, open-source platform which allows users to construct digital logic circuits online. We also offer the [Interactive Book](https://learn.circuitverse.org) which teaches users on the fundamentals of modern, digital circuits. Please also see our [documentation](https://docs.circuitverse.org) or [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/wiki/).

## Getting Started with CircuitVerse code base ðŸ“¹
To help new contributors get started, we've created a video guide titled **"Getting Started with CircuitVerse"**. This video covers:
- Introduction to CircuitVerse and its technical structure.
- Step-by-step setup using GitHub Codespaces.
- A high level walkthrough of the codebase directory structure and key files.
- Contribution guidelines for effective collaboration.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

  1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/CircuitVerse/cv-frontend-vue.git
  ```
  2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```
  cd cv-frontend-vue
  ```
  3. Install the project dependencies:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  4. Start the development server:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

## Setting up on cloud with Stackblitz
[StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/user-guide/what-is-stackblitz) is an instant fullstack web IDE for the JavaScript ecosystem.

  1. Initiate the setup process by clicking on the following button:

  [![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/CircuitVerse/cv-frontend-vue)

  2. Once the setup is complete, a Preview URL will be displayed in the browser window. Append `/simulatorvue/` to your URL to access the simulator.
  ```
  https://<preview_url>/simulatorvue/
  ```

## How to Use Vue Simulator with CircuitVerse Main Repo
To access the Vue Simulator from the [CircuitVerse main repo](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse) dev server, you can follow one of the following methods:

### Accessing Vue Simulator
  1. Start the CircuitVerse Main Repo dev server.
  2. go to the `/vuesimulator` path in the dev server.
  3. You would be accessing the Vue Simulator.

### Setting Vue Simulator as Default
  1. Log in to the CircuitVerse dev server using the admin account:
      - **Email:** `admin@circuitverse.org`
      - **Password:** `password`
  2. Once logged in, go to `/flipper` path and turn on vuesim feature flag site wide or for your user.
  3. After activation, you will be able to access the Vue Simulator site-wide in your dev server, also in `/simulator` path the Vue Simulator will be opening instead of the old simulator.
