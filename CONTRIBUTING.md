- `difficulty: easy` issues are usually confined to isolated areas of existing code.
- `difficulty: medium` issues sometimes entail new features and might affect a significant area of the codebase, but aren't overly complex.
- `difficulty: hard` issues are typically far-reaching, and might need architecture decisions during implementation. This label might also denote highly complex issues.
- `duplicate` labeled issues are meant to be already existing issue in the repository.
- `priority: less` labeled issues are meant to have priority comparatavily lesser than other issues.

## Creating an issue.

- Check if the issue you are going to propose is not duplicate of another issue.
- Open a new issue according to type i.e., if issue is a bug open a new issue by clicking on `Get Started` in the scope of `Bug Report`.
- Give a precise and meaningful name of the issue.
- Describe your issue as good as possible that may ease the process of issue-reviewing by a community member.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the project and clone it to your local machine. Follow the [setup](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/blob/master/SETUP.md) guideline.
2. Always take a pull from the remote repository to your master branch to keep it at par with the main project(updated repository).
        
        git pull upstream master
        
3. Create a branch. For example, if you are going to work on issue number #44 (which is, say, a new feature for ‘forgot password’ management):

        git checkout -b forgot-password#44

    This both creates and checks out that branch in one command.  
    The feature name should provide a (short) description of the issue.

4. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
5. Commit your changes and push it to your fork of the repository.
6. Create Pull Request (PR). Make sure to comment the issue that your PR is supposed to solve.

## Create a pull request

- Try to keep the pull requests small. A pull request should try its very best to address only a single concern.
- For work in progress pull requests, please use the Draft PR feature.
- Make sure all tests pass and add additional tests for the code you submit.
- Document your reasoning behind the changes. Explain why you wrote the code in the way you did. The code should explain what it does.
- If there's an existing issue, reference to it by adding something like `References/Closes/Fixes/Resolves #123`, where 123 is the issue number. 
- Please fill out the PR Template when making a PR.

> Please note: maintainers may close your PR if it has gone stale or if we don't plan to merge the code.

## Pull request reviews

- Requested changes must be resolved (with code or discussion) before merging.
- If you make changes to a PR, be sure to re-request a review.
- Don't repeadetely tag someone(may be it is not the right time to review your PR), be patient.
- Do not 'resolve conversation' unnecessary raised by a community member or any workflow tools(codeclimate or hound) as they may have some purpose, try to resolve the request changes and if any help wanted tag a community member to give views about that.
