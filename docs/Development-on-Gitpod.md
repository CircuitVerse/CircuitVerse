CircuitVerse has been set to auto preview mode and so you can view the local port on the same screen on the right side. You can now simultaneously make changes and view them. This however takes some time to load, wait for some time to view the same.

After making changes you can save them to your workspace and re-run the preview using the command:

**bundle exec rails s**

At last, you can close your workspace by clicking on `File -> Close` Workspace and then stop the workspace by `File -> Stop Workspace`. This will redirect you to your Dashboard where you can restart it again.
