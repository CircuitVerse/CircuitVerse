## Code Understanding and AI Usage

**Did you use AI assistance (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) to write any part of this code?**
- [ ] No, I wrote all the code myself
- [ ] Yes, I used AI assistance (continue below)

**If you used AI assistance:**
- [ ] I have reviewed every single line of the AI-generated code
- [ ] I can explain the purpose and logic of each function/component I added
- [ ] I have tested edge cases and understand how the code handles them
- [ ] I have modified the AI output to follow this project's coding standards and conventions

**Explain your implementation approach:**
<!-- 
Describe in your own words:
- What problem does your code solve?
- What alternative approaches did you consider?
- Why did you choose this specific implementation?
- What are the key functions/components and what do they do?

This helps reviewers understand your thought process and ensures you understand the code.
