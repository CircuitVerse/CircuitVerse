  # = Body
  #
  # The body is where the text of the email is stored.  Mail treats the body
  # as a single object.  The body itself has no information about boundaries
  # used in the MIME standard, it just looks at its content as either a single
  # block of text, or (if it is a multipart message) as an array of blocks of text.
  #
  # A body has to be told to split itself up into a multipart message by calling
  # #split with the correct boundary.  This is because the body object has no way
  # of knowing what the correct boundary is for itself (there could be many
  # boundaries in a body in the case of a nested MIME text).
  #
  # Once split is called, Mail::Body will slice itself up on this boundary,
  # assigning anything that appears before the first part to the preamble, and
  # anything that appears after the closing boundary to the epilogue, then
  # each part gets initialized into a Mail::Part object.
  #
  # The boundary that is used to split up the Body is also stored in the Body
  # object for use on encoding itself back out to a string.  You can
  # overwrite this if it needs to be changed.
  #
  # On encoding, the body will return the preamble, then each part joined by
  # the boundary, followed by a closing boundary string and then the epilogue.

  #     colon.  A field body may be composed of any US-ASCII characters,
  #     except for CR and LF.  However, a field body may contain CRLF when
  #     used in header "folding" and  "unfolding" as described in section
  #     2.2.3.  All field bodies MUST conform to the syntax described in
  #     sections 3 and 4 of this standard.

  #     described above. These are referred to as "structured" field bodies.
  #     Structured field bodies are sequences of specific lexical tokens as

  #     are allowed (according to their syntax) to be introduced or end with

  #     ASCII value 32) and horizontal tab (HTAB, ASCII value 9) characters
  #     (together known as the white space characters, WSP), and those WSP
  #     characters are subject to header "folding" and "unfolding" as

module Mail
  # Provides access to an unstructured header field
  #
  # ===Per RFC 2822:
  #  2.2.1. Unstructured Header Field Bodies
  #
  #     Some field bodies in this standard are defined simply as
  #     "unstructured" (which is specified below as any US-ASCII characters,
  #     except for CR and LF) with no further restrictions.  These are
  #     referred to as unstructured field bodies.  Semantically, unstructured
  #     field bodies are simply to be treated as a single line of characters
  #     with no further processing (except for header "folding" and
  #     "unfolding" as described in section 2.2.3).
  class UnstructuredField < CommonField
    def initialize: (untyped name, untyped value, ?untyped? charset) -> void

    # An unstructured field does not parse

    def do_decode: () -> (nil | untyped)

    # 2.2.3. Long Header Fields
    #
    #  Each header field is logically a single line of characters comprising
    #  the field name, the colon, and the field body.  For convenience
    #  however, and to deal with the 998/78 character limitations per line,
    #  the field body portion of a header field can be split into a multiple
    #  line representation; this is called "folding".  The general rule is
    #  that wherever this standard allows for folding white space (not
    #  simply WSP characters), a CRLF may be inserted before any WSP.  For
    #  example, the header field:
    #
    #          Subject: This is a test
    #
    #  can be represented as:
    #
    #          Subject: This
    #           is a test
    #
    #  Note: Though structured field bodies are defined in such a way that
    #  folding can take place between many of the lexical tokens (and even
    #  within some of the lexical tokens), folding SHOULD be limited to
    #  placing the CRLF at higher-level syntactic breaks.  For instance, if
    #  a field body is defined as comma-separated values, it is recommended
    #  that folding occur after the comma separating the structured items in
    #  preference to other places where the field could be folded, even if
    #  it is allowed elsewhere.
    def wrapped_value: () -> untyped

    # 6.2. Display of 'encoded-word's
    #
    #  When displaying a particular header field that contains multiple
    #  'encoded-word's, any 'linear-white-space' that separates a pair of
    #  adjacent 'encoded-word's is ignored.  (This is to allow the use of
    #  multiple 'encoded-word's to represent long strings of unencoded text,
    #  without having to separate 'encoded-word's where spaces occur in the
    #  unencoded text.)

  #
  #  2.2. Header Fields
  #
  #   Header fields are lines composed of a field name, followed by a colon
  #   (":"), followed by a field body, and terminated by CRLF.  A field
  #   name MUST be composed of printable US-ASCII characters (i.e.,
  #   characters that have values between 33 and 126, inclusive), except
  #   colon.  A field body may be composed of any US-ASCII characters,
  #   except for CR and LF.  However, a field body may contain CRLF when
  #   used in header "folding" and  "unfolding" as described in section
  #   2.2.3.  All field bodies MUST conform to the syntax described in
  #   sections 3 and 4 of this standard.

    #  3.6. Field definitions
    #
    #   It is important to note that the header fields are not guaranteed to
    #   be in a particular order.  They may appear in any order, and they
    #   have been known to be reordered occasionally when transported over
    #   the Internet.  However, for the purposes of this standard, header
    #   fields SHOULD NOT be reordered when a message is transported or
    #   transformed.  More importantly, the trace header fields and resent
    #   header fields MUST NOT be reordered, and SHOULD be kept in blocks
    #   prepended to the message.  See sections 3.6.6 and 3.6.7 for more
    #   information.

    #   field may occur in a message header as well as any special
    #   limitations on the use of those fields.  An asterisk next to a value
    #   in the minimum or maximum column indicates that a special restriction
    #   appears in the Notes column.
    #
    #   <snip table from 3.6>
    #
    # As per RFC, many fields can appear more than once, we will return a string
    # of the value if there is only one header, or if there is more than one
    # matching header, will return an array of values in order that they appear
    # in the header ordered from top to bottom.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #  h = Header.new
    #  h.fields = ['To: mikel@me.com', 'X-Mail-SPAM: 15', 'X-Mail-SPAM: 20']

  # Creating via a string:
  #
  #  string = "To: mikel@test.lindsaar.net\r\n"
  #  string << "From: bob@test.lindsaar.net\r\n"
  #  string << "Subject: This is an email\r\n"
  #  string << "\r\n"
  #  string << "This is the body"
  #  Mail.new(string)

  #    subject 'This is an email'

module Mail
  # The Message class provides a single point of access to all things to do with an
  # email message.
  #
  # You create a new email message by calling the Mail::Message.new method, or just
  # Mail.new
  #
  # A Message object by default has the following objects inside it:
  #
  # * A Header object which contains all information and settings of the header of the email
  # * Body object which contains all parts of the email that are not part of the header, this
  #   includes any attachments, body text, MIME parts etc.
  #
  # ==Per RFC2822
  #
  #  2.1. General Description
  #
  #   At the most basic level, a message is a series of characters.  A
  #   message that is conformant with this standard is comprised of
  #   characters with values in the range 1 through 127 and interpreted as
  #   US-ASCII characters [ASCII].  For brevity, this document sometimes
  #   refers to this range of characters as simply "US-ASCII characters".
  #
  #   Note: This standard specifies that messages are made up of characters
  #   in the US-ASCII range of 1 through 127.  There are other documents,
  #   specifically the MIME document series [RFC2045, RFC2046, RFC2047,
  #   RFC2048, RFC2049], that extend this standard to allow for values
  #   outside of that range.  Discussion of those mechanisms is not within
  #   the scope of this standard.
  #
  #   Messages are divided into lines of characters.  A line is a series of
  #   characters that is delimited with the two characters carriage-return
  #   and line-feed; that is, the carriage return (CR) character (ASCII
  #   value 13) followed immediately by the line feed (LF) character (ASCII
  #   value 10).  (The carriage-return/line-feed pair is usually written in
  #   this document as "CRLF".)
  #
  #   A message consists of header fields (collectively called "the header
  #   of the message") followed, optionally, by a body.  The header is a
  #   sequence of lines of characters with special syntax as defined in
  #   this standard. The body is simply a sequence of characters that
  #   follows the header and is separated from the header by an empty line
  #   (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF).
  class Message
    # ==Making an email
    #
    # You can make an new mail object via a block, passing a string, file or direct assignment.
    #
    # ===Making an email via a block
    #
    #  mail = Mail.new do |m|
    #    m.from 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'
    #    m.to 'you@test.lindsaar.net'
    #    m.subject 'This is a test email'
    #    m.body File.read('body.txt')
    #  end
    #
    #  mail.to_s #=> "From: mikel@test.lindsaar.net\r\nTo: you@...
    #
    # If may also pass a block with no arguments, in which case it will
    # be evaluated in the scope of the new message instance:
    #
    #  mail = Mail.new do
    #    from 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'
    #    # …
    #  end
    #
    # ===Making an email via passing a string
    #
    #  mail = Mail.new("To: mikel@test.lindsaar.net\r\nSubject: Hello\r\n\r\nHi there!")
    #  mail.body.to_s #=> 'Hi there!'
    #  mail.subject   #=> 'Hello'
    #  mail.to        #=> 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'
    #
    # ===Making an email from a file
    #
    #  mail = Mail.read('path/to/file.eml')
    #  mail.body.to_s #=> 'Hi there!'
    #  mail.subject   #=> 'Hello'
    #  mail.to        #=> 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'
    #
    # ===Making an email via assignment
    #
    # You can assign values to a mail object via four approaches:
    #
    # * Message#field_name=(value)
    # * Message#field_name(value)
    # * Message#['field_name']=(value)
    # * Message#[:field_name]=(value)
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #  mail = Mail.new
    #  mail['from'] = 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'
    #  mail[:to]    = 'you@test.lindsaar.net'
    #  mail.subject 'This is a test email'
    #  mail.body    = 'This is a body'
    #
    #  mail.to_s #=> "From: mikel@test.lindsaar.net\r\nTo: you@...

    # If you assign a delivery handler, mail will call :deliver_mail on the
    # object you assign to delivery_handler, it will pass itself as the
    # single argument.
    #
    # If you define a delivery_handler, then you are responsible for the
    # following actions in the delivery cycle:
    #
    # * Appending the mail object to Mail.deliveries as you see fit.
    # * Checking the mail.perform_deliveries flag to decide if you should
    #   actually call :deliver! the mail object or not.
    # * Checking the mail.raise_delivery_errors flag to decide if you
    #   should raise delivery errors if they occur.
    # * Actually calling :deliver! (with the bang) on the mail object to
    #   get it to deliver itself.
    #
    # A simplest implementation of a delivery_handler would be
    #
    #   class MyObject

    #     def deliver_mail(mail)
    #       yield
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Then doing:
    #
    #   obj = MyObject.new
    #   obj.mail.deliver
    #
    # Would cause Mail to call obj.deliver_mail passing itself as a parameter,
    # which then can just yield and let Mail do its own private do_delivery
    # method.
    attr_accessor delivery_handler: untyped

    # If set to false, mail will go through the motions of doing a delivery,
    # but not actually call the delivery method or append the mail object to

    #   mail.deliver                        # Mail::SMTP not called here
    #   Mail.deliveries.size #=> 0
    #
    # If you want to test and query the Mail.deliveries collection to see what
    # mail you sent, you should set perform_deliveries to true and use
    # the :test mail delivery_method:
    #
    #   Mail.deliveries.size #=> 0

    #   mail.perform_deliveries = true

    # email that is older than another will appear first.
    #
    # Example:
    #

    #    date(Time.now)
    #  end
    #  mail2 = Mail.new do

    def <=>: (untyped other) -> (1 | untyped)

    # Two emails are the same if they have the same fields and body contents. One
    # gotcha here is that Mail will insert Message-IDs when calling encoded, so doing
    # mail1.encoded == mail2.encoded is most probably not going to return what you think
    # as the assigned Message-IDs by Mail (if not already defined as the same) will ensure
    # that the two objects are unique, and this comparison will ALWAYS return false.
    #
    # So the == operator has been defined like so:  Two messages are the same if they have
    # the same content, ignoring the Message-ID field, unless BOTH emails have a defined and
    # different Message-ID value, then they are false.
    #
    # So, in practice the == operator works like this:
    #
    #  m1 = Mail.new("Subject: Hello\r\n\r\nHello")
    #  m2 = Mail.new("Subject: Hello\r\n\r\nHello")
    #  m1 == m2 #=> true

    #
    # +mb_chars+ is a multibyte safe proxy for string methods.
    #
    # In Ruby 1.8 and older it creates and returns an instance of the Mail::Multibyte::Chars class which
    # encapsulates the original string. A Unicode safe version of all the String methods are defined on this proxy
    # class. If the proxy class doesn't respond to a certain method, it's forwarded to the encapsuled string.

    #   name.mb_chars.reverse.to_s # => "rellüM sualC"
    #   name.mb_chars.length       # => 12
    #
    # In Ruby 1.9 and newer +mb_chars+ returns +self+ because String is (mostly) encoding aware. This means that
    # it becomes easy to run one version of your code on multiple Ruby versions.
    #
    # == Method chaining
    #
    # All the methods on the Chars proxy which normally return a string will return a Chars object. This allows
    # method chaining on the result of any of these methods.

    # String and Char work like expected. The bang! methods change the internal string representation in the Chars
    # object. Interoperability problems can be resolved easily with a +to_s+ call.

  #
  # Mail allows you to send emails using SMTP.  This is done by wrapping Net::SMTP in
  # an easy to use manner.
  #
  # === Sending via SMTP server on Localhost
  #
  # Sending locally (to a postfix or sendmail server running on localhost) requires
  # no special setup.  Just to Mail.deliver &block or message.deliver! and it will
  # be sent in this method.
  #
  # === Sending via MobileMe
  #
  #   Mail.defaults do
  #     delivery_method :smtp, { :address              => "smtp.me.com",
  #                              :port                 => 587,
  #                              :domain               => 'your.host.name',
  #                              :user_name            => '<username>',

  #                              :enable_starttls_auto => true  }
  #   end
  #
  # === Sending via GMail
  #
  #   Mail.defaults do
  #     delivery_method :smtp, { :address              => "smtp.gmail.com",
  #                              :port                 => 587,
  #                              :domain               => 'your.host.name',

  #                              :enable_starttls_auto => true  }
  #   end
  #
  # === Certificate verification
  #
  # When using TLS, some mail servers provide certificates that are self-signed
  # or whose names do not exactly match the hostname given in the address.
  # OpenSSL will reject these by default. The best remedy is to use the correct
  # hostname or update the certificate authorities trusted by your ruby. If
  # that isn't possible, you can control this behavior with
  # an :openssl_verify_mode setting. Its value may be either an OpenSSL
  # verify mode constant (OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE, OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER),
  # or a string containing the name of an OpenSSL verify mode (none, peer).
  #
  # === Others
  #
  # Feel free to send me other examples that were tricky
  #
