# Attachments associate records with blobs. Usually that's a one record-many blobs relationship,
# but it is possible to associate many different records with the same blob. A foreign-key constraint
# on the attachments table prevents blobs from being purged if theyâ€™re still attached to any records.
#
# Attachments also have access to all methods from {ActiveStorage::Blob}[rdoc-ref:ActiveStorage::Blob].
class ActiveStorage::Attachment < ActiveStorage::Record
  # Synchronously deletes the attachment and {purges the blob}[rdoc-ref:ActiveStorage::Blob#purge].
  def purge: () -> untyped

  # Deletes the attachment and {enqueues a background job}[rdoc-ref:ActiveStorage::Blob#purge_later] to purge the blob.
