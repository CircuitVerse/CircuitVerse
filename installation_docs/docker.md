3. Open `CircuitVerse` directory
4. Open `PowerShell` in the current directory
5. Run `./bin/docker_run.ps1`
6. Wait for the docker container to be prepared
7. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

- run the following command in Powershell as Administrator
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
