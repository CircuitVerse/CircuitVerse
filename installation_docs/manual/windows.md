## Installation on Windows

#### Cloning From GitHub
To clone the repository, use following command with an **administrative shell**

```sh
git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse.git --recursive
cd CircuitVerse
```

**Note:** If you want to contribute, first fork the original repository and clone your **forked** repository into your local machine. If you don't do this, you will not be able to make commits or change any files.
```sh
git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/<username>/CircuitVerse.git --recursive
cd CircuitVerse
```

- Use `git submodule update --init` to get the contents of the submodule if you missed using the `--recursive` option while cloning the repository or if you have already done so.

4. Configure your PostgreSQL database in `config/database.yml` (copy `config/database.example.yml` for the template): 
     * **(macOS/linux):** `cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml`
     * **Note:** The Postgres credentials need to be updated to your currently running database
5. Create database: `bundle exec rails db:create`
6. Run database migrations: `bundle exec rails db:migrate`
7. Seed the database with some data: `bundle exec rails db:seed`
8. Open GIT bash in current folder
8. Run `bin/dev` to run application server, background job queue and asset compiler
