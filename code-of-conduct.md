# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of the level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Diversity and inclusion make the CircuitVerse community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.

## Expected Behaviour

- Be professional.
- Be responsible.
- Be welcoming.
- Be kind and courteous.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
- Be supportive and look out for each other.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Harassment may include but not limited to the following:
- Offensive, inappropriate, or unwanted comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or age, or other protected categories under applicable law.
- Disrespect towards differences of opinion
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate or unwanted physical contact
- Intimidation or bullying (online or in-person)
- Unwelcome sexual attention

## Reporting and Enforcement

- If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, inform us @ <support@circuitverse.org>.
- The project lead’s word is final. If the community chooses to question the wisdom of the actions of a committer, the project lead can review their decisions, and either uphold or reverse them.
