# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of the level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Diversity and inclusion make the CircuitVerse community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.

## Expected Behaviour

- Be professional.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Harassment may include but not limited to the following:
- Offensive, inappropriate, or unwanted comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or age, or other protected categories under applicable law.
